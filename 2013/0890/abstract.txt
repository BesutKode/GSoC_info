The purpose of this project will be to create window system backends to
deploy XBMC on modern linux windowing systems and provide automated tests
such that the code doesn't fall into bitrot for windowing systems which
might not be heavily used at the moment.

Ideally, the project will allow xbmc to run natively when either: Directly on the linux framebuffer (eg, GBM / KMS), Via the wayland protocol on Weston, Via the Mir protocol on the Mir Compositor.
