Design and user experience unfortunately is still neglected in many open source projects. ownCloud aims to change that and get people involved in the design process. Currently, ownCloud lacks complete uniformity in the front-end of the Files and User Management modules. All the modules have their own specific front-end independent from each other. The project plans to implement a common layout for these 2 modules so as to make the user experience  seamless and keeping the software modules consistent with each other.
