Plugin for VisualEditor in the areas of source code editing, providing support to insert source codes easily, allowing features such as simple grammar checking, indentation correction, and beautifying code. The VisualEditor would definitely need these features and as a programmer I feel it is necessary to have these basic functions in every possible text editor that supports source code markups.
