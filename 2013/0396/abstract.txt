The validation module is a useful tool for finding problems with your DB. It runs OpenMRS validators against different data and matadata in your system. It is particularly handy for implementations migrating to OpenMRS 1.9. In OpenMRS versions earlier than 1.9 objects were not always validated before persisting them to the DB and after upgrading to OpenMRS 1.9 you may want to make sure that your objects are valid before discovering that only after trying to modify them.

The goal of this GSoC project is to enhance the Validation module by providing a more polished UI, improved error reports and automatic fixes for common problems.
