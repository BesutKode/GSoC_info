The JVM's are becoming faster and efficient now. On the other hand we are now observing the development of embedded devices in home automation, security, automobiles etc. To fulfill the need and widen the use of JRuby, we have to provide support for such embedded devices. The aim of this project is to get JRuby ported on J2SE supporting JVM running on low configuration embedded device.
