Open Source Event Manager is a platform for foss event planning. 
OSEM being a new project, has several things that need to be done. 
My GSOC project aims to focus on 3 categories:

A. Implement features to make use easier

B. Implement features that help reduce workload of event organizers

C.Introduce new features that aim to concentrate more elements of a larger-scale conference organization into a single platform
