LibreDWG GNU is a library programmed in C language for reading and writing DWG(DraWinG) files. DWG is binary file format for storing 2-D and 3-D design data and meta data. LibreDWG supports three versions of DWG : 
DWG 2000(fully implemented),
DWG 2004(partially implemented), 
DWG 2007(partially implemented).
Functionality of last two versions is not complete.So, it needs to finish the decoding part of these versions. Partially decoded functions of these DWG versions are in a single file. As a consequence, it requires refactoring and proper developer's documentation.
