In the version 3 of the Joomla! CMS, Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery is added to the core code base. Previous versions of the CMS had been using MooTools as the preferred JavaScript library. Currently, both JavaScript libraries are shipped and used within the CMS, which occasionally causes conflicts with a user's JavaScript functionality. The goal of the project is to reduce the dependency of CMS on MooTools by converting its core JavaScript behaviors from MooTools to jQuery and JavaScript.
