The public laboratoryâ€™s Spectral Workbench provides its users with tools to share the spectra and work on it. I would like to add an extra yet important functionality. A scalable spectral matching mechanism. With this in place, the users will be able to see some results which show up when the system finds some similar spectra in the database. This helps the user explore and learn more about his/her uploaded spectrum.
