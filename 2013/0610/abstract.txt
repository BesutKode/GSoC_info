MedSavant is a search engine for genomic variants. It is a server-client application with the server mainly dedicated to fetching results via Infobright Community Edition, a specialized, SQL-based, single-threaded database. A query on a huge dataset can be optimized by dividing the dataset into pieces called shards and assembling the results. This project aims to allow such parallelization of queries in MedSavant.
