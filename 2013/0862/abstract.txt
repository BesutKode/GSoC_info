The GNURadio is an open source community which provides continuous signal processing solutions for Software Defined Radio. The basic development of GNU Radio toolkit is done in a manner to make it compatible with low-cost RF hardware to achieve SDRs. Primarily written in Python and C++, the toolkit provides user to real time radio systems in a simple enviornment. The aim of this Project is to develop an OFDM Reciever for GNURadio and integrate wireshar into it. Hence enabling GNURadio as a tool which can receive the packets for OFDM and analyse the algorithm implemented on network as well.
