It has been observed that when running relatively big Ganeti clusters with lots of VMs on them, the major problem when allocating (or rebalancing) is the CPU load. Only the number of CPUs of every node is being taken in account at the moment which results to imbalanced nodes. The proposed idea is to also take in account a metric for each nodeâ€™s CPU load in a time window t, export this information for every node to hail and then choose to allocate with a corresponding policy.
