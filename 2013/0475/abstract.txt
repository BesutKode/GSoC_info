Build a new and flexible web admin module for 52Â°North Web Processing Service. The architecture should be pluggable and allow for the integration of configuration modules, the definition of configuration parameters, and the retrieval of configuration values during runtime and in a type safe manner. In addition, the web module should provide the ability to configure repositories, generators, parsers, users, logs, and other settings through a modern user interface.
