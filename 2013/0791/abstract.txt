The goal of this project is to make a prototype for an inline commenting system where a user after landing to a wiki article can make useful comments on some part of the text and other users can optionally reply back to it. This will be implemented as a separate extension. I will be using the OKFN technology available under the MIT license which provides the user with tools to annotate text. The API methods will be provided to retrieve comments and to update them.
