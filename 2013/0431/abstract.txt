LyX is a WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) document processor that helps the user create semantically-rich and nicely-formatted content without spending time agonizing over layout or typesetting. This project focuses on the exporting of LyX documents to other formats, and it aims both to improve the existing support for exporting to XHTML and to implement exporting to ePub for the first time.
