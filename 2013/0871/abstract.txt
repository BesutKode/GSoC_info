The project aims at making a GUI which would lead to a hassle free, application specific configuration of RTEMS. The GUI would be made dynamically so as to be low on maintenance and will run on all major platforms. It would also be able to generate a .h file (having modified configurations) which could be used by the application. The GUI would be implemented in wxPython whilst the TUI implementation could be done on ncurses. Also the GUI would be packaged with the libraries it uses so that it could be installed out of the box.
