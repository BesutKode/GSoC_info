The project is to write a minimal compiler of ANSI Common Lisp code to an intermediate representation that can be interpreted efficiently within an existing Common Lisp system, along with the corresponding interpreter.  The compiler/interpreter combination will be designed as an alternative to the high-overhead native code compilation process that SBCL already provides, intended to be used in situations where compilation overhead weighs more heavily than raw performance of compiled code.
