In Debian Blends a basic way to install packages belonging to a certain user task is a set of so called metapackages. The package blends-dev is responsible for creating these metapackages taking as input data task files, which specify dependecies from binary packages. The current implementation is using information from the system where blends-dev is called to validate the dependencies. In practice this has the effect that the most popular architectures (i386, amd64) are used as reference for metapackages which are intended to work on all available Debian architectures. The task of the GSoC project is to rewrite the blends-dev code to enable architecture dependent metapackages creation.
