At the moment, the only real API to access WP content is the XML-RPC API. This requires a full suite of parsing tools and is less than optimal for most users. In the past, XML parsing (usually with libxml) has caused problems on mobile platforms, which are the main consumers of the API. A JSON REST API removes much of this complexity by using a simpler serialisation format (JSON) with a protocol usable by most of the web via standard HTTP verbs.
