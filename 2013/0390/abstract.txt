Currently Twisted uses ad-hoc parsing methods to parse protocols. The ad-hoc parsing often produces scattered code and makes the code difficult to read and debug. To overcome this problem, I will use Parsley to rewrite the parsing part. In the rewritten version, there will be unified parsing grammar and dedicated classes that handle parsing logic. Thus, the parsing code will be less error-prone and more concise. Moreover, parsing performance will be easily improved by enhancing Parsley itself.
