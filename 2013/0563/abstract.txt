Many machine learning libraries have been developed since the development of the computer. Advanced and scalable machine learning libraries such as MLPACK need a huge amount of work, primarily from the side of developers, but also from the research side. For that reason it's crucial to the project to have up-to-date benchmarks to get informations which changesets have caused speedups or slowdowns. This project entails writing support scripts which will run machine learning methods especially from MLPACK, but also from competing libraries and produce runtime information.
