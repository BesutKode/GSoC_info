I propose that TYPO3 Neos adopt a new package type: a Boilerplate. For this GSOC project, I will create two example Boilerplate packages: Twitter Bootstrap and HTML5 Boilerplate. I will build a Boilerplate framework in a TYPO3.FluidBoilerplate package. This package will provide a RESTful api for a decoupled UI (similar to TemplaVoila). The UI will be in the TYPO3.FluidBuilder package, however I will focus more on the backend layer in TYPO3.FluidBoilerplate.
