File systems modules are one of the most widely used components of Linux. Each Linux user needs these modules to operate correctly. Errors in file system drivers can lead to serious consequences - from data distortion and loss to critical security vulnerabilities. The change log of Linux kernel shows that errors in file systems modules are still quite common. It is possible to automate file systems modules testing process by make use of special tools combining static and dynamic analysis.
