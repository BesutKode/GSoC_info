Source repositories in Freenet are somewhat inconvenient, requiring manual sharing of repository keys, and having no features apart from push and pull. I'd like to extend Infocalypse to use WoT to make it easier to push, pull, and discuss code. This means the ability to publish repositories under WoT identities, and allowing others to make comments and pull requests. In a phrase, I hope to build a distributed GitHub over Freenet.
