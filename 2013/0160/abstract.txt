Now DHIS2 server has visualizer module. It currently uses ExtJS as the framework and this module is a widely across the globe for data analysis in DHIS2. The project that I'd be working on this summer is to port the same functionality to work on smartphone devices. I will to use Sencha Touch2 and Sencha Charts to provide the same features. This will allow me to re-use a lot of ExtJS code from that module. It will also give one bonus. Using Sencha Touch Charts, I can create HTML5 mobile applications by packaging them through PhoneGap or something else in future. So in future I will try convert my html5 app to smartphone application.
