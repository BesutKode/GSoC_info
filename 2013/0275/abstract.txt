James is a complete and extensible enterprise ready mail server solution. Currently, it has to be configured through manual edition of its many XML configurations files, or through a JMX client, a rather unfriendly configuration approach. A web management interface would let the administrator manage the configuration, management and monitoring options in a much user friendly solution.
