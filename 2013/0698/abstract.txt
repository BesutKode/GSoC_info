GNOME has very powerful desktop applications which can do activities ranging from resizing disk-partitions to simulating planetariums. Getting Things Gnome! aka GTG is one such software for managing daily tasks. It has a lot of features like â€“ infinite level of subtasks, tags, gnome-shell integration, collaboration support. This proposal aims at building a web application which fully supports all the features of GTG, synchronizes with it, and has a task-sharing functionality. The proposed app would allow users to use GTG on their GNOME desktops and the online interface on other desktop-environments, thereby making GTG usable on both GNOME as well as non-GNOME machines.
