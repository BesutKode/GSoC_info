ns-3 network simulator has ability to exchange traffic in real-time with the outside world (so called "emulation mode"). In particular, it is possible to establish connection between two virtual interfaces on the host machine through the simulated link in ns-3. ns-3 offers broad range of link types, from CSMA Ethernet to 802.11 or even LTE. Goal of the project is to introduce support for such simulated links in mininet and to create a convenient way for establishing them with mininet CLI and Python API.
