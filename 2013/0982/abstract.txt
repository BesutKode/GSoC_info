Currently SuperTuxKart can only be played solo against computer controlled characters or with up to 4 friends on one computer. A great addition to the game would be an online multiplayer option so that users can play together more easily. To provide this new experience, some basic features have to be implemented first. This project includes the most essential features like user registration, server selection and a lobby interface, complemented with an achievement system and the ability to add and challenge friends.
