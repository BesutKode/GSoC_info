When a woman requests to join the Systers community, she must write a short essay that answers three questions. Some applicants do not answer all of the questions because they are only given one long text field in which to input their answers. I will modify the essay to contain both radio buttons and text fields, and I will also add new criteria to this sign up form. Lastly, I will change the Systers database fields so that the answers of applicants can be saved for future reference.
