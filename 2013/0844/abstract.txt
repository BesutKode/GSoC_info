Collaborative editing currently suffers from two main problems:
 1) Setup difficulties. Many existing applications require you to open a port on your system, which can be difficult for various reasons.
 2) Editor application insufficiencies. Existing applications tend to focus on the "collaborative" part of "collaborative editor", and are often not very suitable text editors.
This project aims to solve both problems by implementing a collaborative text editor built on telepathy and KTextEditor.
