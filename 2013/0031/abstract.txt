The visualizations in Weave currently require that data be in a specific format.  For example, if you want to create a scatter plot where the X axis is some measure from one year and the Y axis is the same measure from another year, the two years must be stored as separate columns in the database.  Weave users would like additional flexibility to store the same measure for both years in a single column and the associated year value in a second column.  To support additional storage methods like this, we need the ability to restructure the data in the Weave client.
