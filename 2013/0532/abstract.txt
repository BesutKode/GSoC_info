I would like to make CEGUI capable of rendering images defined in the SVG format. To make this happen, the core library has to be extended with an SVGImage class and the renderers have to be extended to be able to render vector graphics by generating pre-tesselated vertex-geometry shapes that can be rendered in real-time. Additionally, shaders have to be created for the different renderers, so that at least some of the gradient types, defined in the SVG standard, can be rendered using the respective fragment shaders.
