This provides a detailed overview of my proposal to the Python Software Foundation (PSF) serving as an umbrella organization for scikit-image as part of the Google Summer of Code 2013. This project aims to add inpainting abilities to scikit-image library. This would serve as a tool for restoration of damaged information in an image. It can be used to effectively remove overlaying text, cracks in the image and also complete objects from the image. To make it easier for users, we even provide a 'demo_' file to inpaint interactively and test it out.
