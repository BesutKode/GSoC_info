Currently Wikidata stores multilingual contents. Labels (names, descriptions etc) are expected to be written in every language, so every user can read them in their own language. This works for a static data set with labels in all language filled, but it's not the case on Wikidata. This proposal aims at resolving these issues by displaying contents from another language to users based on user preferences (some users may know more than one languages), language similarity (language fallback chain), or the possibility to do transliteration, and allow proper editing on these contents.
