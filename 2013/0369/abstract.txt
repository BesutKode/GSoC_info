This project aims at providing SuperTuxKart a functioning core network, a feature I think SuperTuxKart really need to meet greater success. I don't have the pretentiousness to code everything that this game needs to be fully available online, but this proposal lays the foundations that the game requires. The main goal of this project is that with no addition, game is playable on LAN (and networks with low ping), and that with some additions it becomes available for WAN.
