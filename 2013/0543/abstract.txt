Astroquery is an affiliated package of Astropy developed to allow astronomers to access online Astronomical databases. This is a most useful toolkit, but requires extensive refactoring, testing, documentation and implementation of new services before it conforms to a clean and consistent API and becomes suitable for a stable release. This project intends to do exhaustive work on the Astroquery package to get it into a usable and stable form for fruitful utilization by the Astronomical community.
