In the financial perspective, fedora project can be categorized in to “non-profit organizations”. So it'll be good to have an internal finance system for Fedora Project to handle the budget and transactions in a detailed and very transparent way. Normally Fedora project community plans the budget for an upcoming fiscal year containing four quarters.
And after the budget planning is finished, Red Hat, the sponsor of the Fedora Project will allocate funding the particular budget. Basically this with done by OSAS team and FPL. But there aren't any transaction recording and accounting system at the moment within the fedora project. So my plan is to develop a system that practices the well known double entry system and generate customized reports about the transaction details which are done within the project. customized to integrate with the fedora project's budget and funding routine.
