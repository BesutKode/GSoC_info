Apache Airavata is a framework for managing computational jobs and workflows. An essential part of managing a workflow would be debugging and this project would provide a user friendly light weight webapp in HTML5 and JavaScript with simple visualizations and tools for the administrators to monitors the workflows. This would be an independent module and can be easily attached to their existing webapp or can work as a standalone webapp as well.
