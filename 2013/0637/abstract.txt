Turtle Blocks teaches children an important skill in today's world: programming. Its block-based graphical interface makes abstract concepts like loops easy to understand and fun to play with. But it does not yet support the next step in learning: writing code in a 'real' programming language. My project fills this gap by automatically converting block programs to Python code. It enables the children to transfer their knowledge to a text-based language and to focus on acquiring the new syntax.
