Every open source community thrives on its members,developers,users who contribute, communicate and resolve issues related to the project. Its because of this independence that a open source projects community grows. Such features helps in improvement of project as well as the community. To implement such features there is a need of Private support system for Sigmah website. Sigmah provides for projects related to humanitarian sector.These organization require a platform where in they can post issues,bugs and discuss them. My Gsoc proposal aims at creating such a platform for Sigmah website. This project would help to foster this culture inside NGOs adopting Sigmah, and as a consequence will make Sigmah grow faster.
