Kontact Touch was originally designed to offer Kontacts features on an N900(-like) phone. This makes it look and feel like it does not belong when using it on Plasma Active. I want to polish “Mail” of Kontact Touch by giving it a UI/UX rework to make it  a true PA Application.

This means:

1.) Port Mail  of Kontact Touch to Plasma Components

2.) Rework the interaction design of Mail in the process
