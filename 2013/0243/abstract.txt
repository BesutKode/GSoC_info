Apache Isis a java framework that support to build domain-driven applications. Users are expected to focus in domain entities and application logic then UI representation is generated from the framework itself. Isis is capable to generate user interfaces at runtime. It is already capable to generate such user interfaces using wicket, servlet/jasp and Restful api over http and json. In this project it is expected to adopt this generic user interface designing capabilities to android applications using existing  Restful Objects Interface. At the end of this projects the outcome should be a  generic android app that can generate user interfaces dynamically for any given domain model design using the support of Restful Objects Interface of Isis
