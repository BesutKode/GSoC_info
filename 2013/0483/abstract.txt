DHIS2 is an aggregate indicator system used along with OpenMRS in many countries. SDMX-HD is a standard specification for transmitting time series health data. DHIS2 uses a variant of SDMX-HD as a data exchange format. Other projects have integrated OpenMRS with DHIS2 but not in a user-specifiable manner. This project will involve creating 1 or 2 new renderers for the report module corresponding to the 2 formats and a user interface for mapping report output elements to the exchange format.
