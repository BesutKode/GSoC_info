LyX Document processor provides users with an excellent UI for creating and editing LaTeX tables and math. One drawback of the current implementation is that when a table or math equation is too wide so as not to fit on the screen, the right-hand edge will "disappear" outside the screen limits. This makes editing wider tables and equations more difficult, and sometimes requires users to decrease the font size in LyX to be able to see the full table/equation on the screen. It is needed some sort of a way like a horizontal scroll bar to access the parts of the document, beyond the screen limits.
