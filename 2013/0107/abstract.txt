The aim of the project is to implement:

Seamless file transfer to and from pidgin : 
        Perfecting protocol implementations(prpl) in Pidgin to enable the “Send File..” feature to flawlessly work between libpurple/libpurple and libpurple/non-libpurple clients(Yahoo Messenger and Google Talk).

Alternate file transfer plugin
        Implementing an HTTP file transfer mechanism for cases where file transfer is not able to initiate/undergo due to any reasons.
