Trie is an efficient in-memory ordered tree data structure to deal with string storing and searching. It has better performance in looking up and inserting compared to Binary Search Trees. 
And in comparison to hashtable, it has better expandability and stability, while its performance is no worse. Moreover, it is easy and efficient to look up data with a common prefix. 
In all, trie is a data structure of great importance and wide usage. This project is dedicated in developing a lib providing some containers and interfaces based on the Trie data structure.
