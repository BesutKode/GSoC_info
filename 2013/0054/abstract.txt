For many years, Blenderâ€™s dependency graph and evaluation engine has been long overdue for refactoring. Despite various key subsystems in Blender having already been refactored to become more flexible and powerful in the hands of skilled artists, it has become increasingly clear that artists are currently unable to fully harness the full potential capabilities of these tools due to limitations imposed by the current dependency graph engine. This project aims to investigate and resolve the various design issues involved in creating a new future-proof dependency graph system, and will result in an initial implementation of relevant core components.
