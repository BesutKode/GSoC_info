core.typed is an optional type system for Clojure which can type check idiomatic Clojure code. It is based on Typed Racket, and has the same basic features.

It is clear that several extensions are required to type check some common Clojure idioms. Developing these require careful research and design work. Implemented solutions to these problems will be a primary deliverable for this project.

User documentation will also be extended, and a user guide will be completed.
