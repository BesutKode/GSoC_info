The goal of this project is to facilitate a more visual and high-level understanding of JPF's  textual log output. We will provide a visualization of individual execution states, the history of execution, as well as the execution tree of choices made by JPF.  A more detailed account of the project description can be found at below JIVE website:    http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/jive/JPF.pdf
