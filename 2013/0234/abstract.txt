Ryzom currently uses a renering pipeline with hardcoded shaders in shader assembly.
This project aims to replace that pipeline with one that is programmable using material definitions using high level shader language. Additionally a material editor tool will be created so that materials can be easily defined and previewed.
Also the current 3DS Max plugin for exporting models and materials will be updated to support the new pipeline.
