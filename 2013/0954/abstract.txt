This project will expand the Tux4Kids library to include a cross-platform algebra game, specifically targeting mobile devices and the web. The game will feature a visual representation of equations using boxes for variables, operations and constants. These can be manipulated by the player to solve the given equation. The game builds on Tux Math's current arithmetic exercises, bridging the gap to more abstract, algebraic thinking.
