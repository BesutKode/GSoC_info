The project aims at rewriting the current implementation of the SCORM player which uses Yahoo! User Interface Library 2. This will be achieved by updating the YUI2 code of the SCORM player to YUI3. Additionally, this project will also develop a new HTML5 player to deliver SCORM contents. This would inherently help in delivering SCORM content not only on the Desktop/Laptop browser but also on Mobile devices like iPhone, Andriod devices and tablets like iPad, etc.
