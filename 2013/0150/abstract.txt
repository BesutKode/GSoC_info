FlowVisor currently slices networks but unfortunately provides no mechanism to graphically visualise the slices. Visualising slices is not as trivial as it sounds because FlowVisor slices can be defined on any L1-L4 headers and such slices do not translate naturally to a visual representation. The idea here would be to use the existing API available in FlowVisor (and possibly add some more API) and develop a FlowVisor slice visualizer which will allow an administer and visualize their slices on a web UI.
