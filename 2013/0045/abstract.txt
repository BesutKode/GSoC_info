As OWASP OWTF grows it makes sense to build custom unit tests to automatically re-test that existing functionality remains intact. In this project we would like to create a unit testing framework so that creating OWASP OWTF unit tests is as simple as possible. The goal of this project is to create the Unit Test Framework and as many unit tests as possible to verify OWASP OWTF functionality.
