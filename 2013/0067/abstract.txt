Other mobile platforms such as iOS and Android have a lot of sample apps to teach developers how to use their APIs. I want to build sample apps teaching how to use the each API from the WebAPIs  to be included in the Firefox Marketplace Developer Hub or MDN. These apps would be fully annotated and documented and after studying them developers should have a firm understanding on how to use a given API in the real world.
