Long-term optical tracking is one of most important issue for many computer vision applications in real world scenario. Iâ€™d like to design and develop an API in OpenCV as a common interface for this kind of algorithms. So it will be possible to switch from one algorithm to another algorithm very easily and quickly, as already developed for descriptor and detector. The development in this area is very fragmented and I propose an unique interface useful for plug several algorithms and compare them.
