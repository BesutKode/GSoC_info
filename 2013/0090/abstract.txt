Further expanding Apache Goraâ€™s datastore support is key for becoming a standard persistence framework. The goal of this project is to extend the integration capabilities of Apache Gora. By implementing a new module for Gora, named Gora-OracleNoSQL, this project aims to offer a new NoSQL datastore which will enable Apache Gora users and developers to use the functionality of the enterprise-class Oracle NoSQL database and vice versa.
