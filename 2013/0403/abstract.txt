The purpose of this project is to create a C library that will communicate with mercurial command server. Until now there are some libraries written in other languages like Python, Java, Php, Ruby, etc. Now it's time to create a library for C language.  
There is no code written in C for this library but the existence of other languages libraries will be a good point to start. 
At the end of the summer there will be an API that will be used by all C and C++ users.
