Low density parity check (LDPC) codes are a powerful class of linear error correcting codes. Carefully designed LDPC codes have been shown to achieve performance very close to the Shannon limit in additive white Gaussian noise channels. The goal of this project is to implement LDPC encoder and decoder blocks in GNU Radio for use in real-time transmission, demonstrate their functionality, and examine their capabilities as compared to other blocksâ€™ coding gain.
