Short description: Sensor Web Enablement (SWE) aim is to define a unique environment where specialists and users can search, access, and process data observed by a multitude of heterogeneous sensor networks. In Oceanography common environmental measurements (e.i. current, temperature, chlorophyll, pH, dissolved oxygen, and depth) are usually taken with a CTD profiler or with a GLIDER (AUV - Autonomous Underwater Vehicle). I propose the istSOS implementation of a “profile” data structure  to manage all data profile ideal from fixed or mobile sensor.
