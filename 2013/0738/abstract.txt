Search is an important tool for a web application which lets a user look for a piece of information in a pile of data and improves the usability of a site. MediaGoblin lacks a search interface and it being a platform for sharing of media, it is of utmost importance that we provide a search interface. There are various open source search engines such as Whoosh, ElasticSearch, Xapian that can be integrated with MediaGoblin. This project aims at researching about the best search engine that can be integrated with MediaGoblin according to our use cases and preferences and then implementing it in a way.
