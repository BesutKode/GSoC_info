Abstract Pathfinder is an existing extension of Java Pathfinder (JPF) which allows for different abstractions of numeric types during model checking with JPF.
In this project, we will build upon it by investigating possible approaches to the use of predicates as a supplementary type of abstraction to what already exist in the Abstract Pathfinder.
Furthermore, we will implement the chosen approach as a part of the project.
The solution will address various important features of Java - such as objects, classes, fields, arrays, local variables - and constraints over numeric types.

The overall goal of this project is to enable proper use of predicate abstraction in JPF with a well-defined and complete extension that has its own predicate language.
