In this proposal I explain my plan to
greatly improve the utility of for
comprehensions in Scala. My proposal
is based on a Pre-SIP by Stefan Zeiger, a Pre-SIP by Christopher Vogt and Jan
Braun, and the original Comprehensive
Comprehensions (henceforth, _CC_)
paper by Phillip Wadler and Simon
Peyton (with generalizations).  If my
proposal is implemented, for
comprehensions would gain a power
similar to what is offered by LINQ on
.NET, but, of course, since this is
Scala, they wouldn't be nearly so
inflexible as LINQ, allowing seamless
integration of any correctly-signautured
method defined on comprehendables.
