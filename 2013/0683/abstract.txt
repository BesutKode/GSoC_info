I am a final year Computing Student at Imperial College London, UK. I have undertaken a final-year project that makes use of OpenCV and Qt. I have enjoyed using the OpenCV library greatly which has prompted me to apply for the Summer Of Code 2013. I am looking for a way to contribute to the Open Source Community over the Summer before moving into a Start-Up Incubator in the Autumn. I would be most keen to work on the Android "Hello World" example (having some experience with Android already).
