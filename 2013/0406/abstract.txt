GNUstep currently offers a number of rendering backends inside gnustep-back for its AppKit implementation, gnustep-gui, such as xlib and cairo. 

This proposal primarily involves adding a new rendering backend based on GNUstep's own graphics library, Opal. This will benefit platform compatibility, and various integration efforts.
