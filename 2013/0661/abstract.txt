I would like to create proxy-reverse plugin using the Monkey API. The proxy firstly will parse the HTTP request and depending on rules and of load balancing techniques will get forwarding decision. The forwarding rules will be get from configuration file. The configuration file must be flexible enough, so it will support also perl regular expressions for creating custom rules. Other than rules, there will have possibilities for different load balancing methods.
I want to make the proxy to be really lightweight and fast, so I will try to use as less memory as possible and no locks if possible.
