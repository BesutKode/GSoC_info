This is a project that has two distinct parts. The first is to complete the work that was started in Google Summer of Code 2012 on the project Authentication Plugin Refactoring by refactoring the authentication system. The second part is to implement an OAuth provider to interact with the new authentication system to support login and registration that allows user to log in with a multitude of OAuth providers such as Facebook, Google, and Twitter.
