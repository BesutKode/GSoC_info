This proposal aims at implementing the well-known hybrid hash join algorithm in TAJO. This algorithm is a refinement of the grace hash join which takes advantage of more available memory. Therefore, end users should experience performance gains with the implementation of the hybrid hash join operator. The end results of this work include the hybrid hash join physical operator, unit tests, as well as experimental evaluation and performance analysis.
