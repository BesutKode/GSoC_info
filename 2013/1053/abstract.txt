Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) involves making use of a fleet of vehicles to visit a set of locations. This problem displays considerable commercial relevance and is particularly pertinent to distribution, collection and courier operations. In this project I will implement a TABU search based algorithm for solving VRP in the pgRouting framework. It will solve VRP instances involving one depot, multiple vehicle with capacity and cost and multiple customer with different location and demand.
