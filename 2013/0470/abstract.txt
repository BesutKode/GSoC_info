libvirt provides client/server model virtual machine management.
Communication between client and server is done with libvirt RPC protocol.
Mostly in development, we need to look inside the RPC packet to analyse it.
The project goal is to provide Wireshark's dissector which supports libvirt RPC protocol analysis.
The dissector needs to follow newest libvirt RPC protocol definition.
So we need to provide code-generator of dissector, to make fresh build from newest protocol definition.
