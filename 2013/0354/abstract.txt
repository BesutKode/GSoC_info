The goal of this project is to reverse engineering NVidia's performance counters which are exposed through the CUDA compute profiler which uses CUpti, a high-level API. That profiler allows users to gather timing information about kernel execution and memory transfer operations. The profiler can be used to identify performance bottlenecks in multi-kernel applications or to quantify the benefit of optimizing a single kernel. The main goal of this proposal is to implement the same kind profiler for the nouveau open source driver and then extend it by adding non-compute-related signals.
