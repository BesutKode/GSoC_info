Getting their initial data into Mifos X when setting the platform up for the first time is often time-consuming and difficult for MFIs. This project will create an Excel-based data import tool for directly importing bulk data into Mifos X. Using the REST APIs exposed by the platform, this tool will import the following data: Client Details, Client Loan and Saving account details, Client Fee Details, Client repayment History as well as Center / Group details and Personnel Details.  Upon completing their initial organizational and loan product configuration, the MFI can generate a pre-formatted Excel template to import their data in. These templates will primarily be used for inputting manual paper-based or other Excel-based data but could also be used for migration from another system database.
