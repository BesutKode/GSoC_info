Even though there's already some auto-completion in virsh, it is not enough. For better user experience, virsh should auto complete objects to virsh commands, e.g. "start <TAB><TAB>" lists not only options that the start command knows, but list of inactive domains as well. Moreover, the same applies to command options.
