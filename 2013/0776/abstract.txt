In version 3.1, phpBB introduces extensions as a way to add functionality to a forum, enabling third party contributors to modify behavior without altering phpBB core files. To stimulate the development of extensions, it is desirable that some real-world examples are available for these contributors. In this proposal, I explain how I intend to write a karma (or: reputation) system extension as a Google Summer of Code project.
