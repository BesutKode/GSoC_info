The Reporting Module provides to the OpenMRS user the ability to get data from the software in a readable and friendly way, such data can be presented in different formats. These types of Report Renderers share a generic user interface instead of having one per renderer that suits the characteristics and configuration options of each one. This project aims to solve this not only by creating a user interface for each renderer, but also by allowing extensibility.
