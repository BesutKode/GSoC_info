The DirectX 11 Render System is not fully completed on Ogre3D. There is a lot of space for core improvements, like multi-threading support, use immutable state object for state management, read back depth-stencil buffer as texture, support new texture codecs BC6/BC7. Moreover tessellation feature is not really used. This feature can do a lot more like displacement mapping support, complex geometry generation for water and terrain with tessellation stages, render physically correct movements with compute shader and tessellation stages.
Finally, I want to improve how Ogre3D works on winRT.
