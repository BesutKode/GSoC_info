Package Tracking System (PTS) is currently a mess of various technologies and languages: Perl, Python, XSLT which makes it extremely hard to maintain and extend. It includes an e-mail and Web interface for viewing information about packages, but the information shown is rather fixed and adding something new is a daunting task. Finally, since it is based on generating static HTML files, it does not offer real-time up-to-date information. This project aims to rewrite the application using Python and the Django framework in order to solve these problems by making a modular modern Django application.
