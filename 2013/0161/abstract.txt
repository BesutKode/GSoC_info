This proposal describes a GSoC project for developing improvements to three simulation models in ns-3 LTE module. 3GPP E-UTRAN specifications and several research publications will be used as references. The proposal serves as the opportunity to introduce myself as the developer and the project itself. The project aims to contribute a useful, efficient, and verified set of features to the ns-3 simulator, and the proposal demonstrates the realistic approaches that will be taken to achieve it.
