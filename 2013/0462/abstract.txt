The aim of this project is to build a Firefox add-on that provides security related information (such as SSL certificate errors, CSP  violation reports, non-secure cookies, etc) of a website to users in a single place. This will help users better discern malicious attempts and allow benign web developers to easily identify security issues in their production pages. The contribution of this project is to enhance security by raising awareness about website security bugs and arming users with specific information about current website security practices.
