As suggested by Kojo, my project will be the implementation of script tracing in the IDE. Such a feature would be a powerful tool in the hands of programmers attempting to debug their code. It will consist of a new window mode in Kojo, where pressing a "trace" button will trace the program. A history of the trace will allow the user to go through all calls and see the state of visible variables at that point.
