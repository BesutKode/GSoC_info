Debian maintainers don't have tools to automate the packaging of software made with Leiningen and Clojure. This project will be divided into 2 parts: The first part will be packing the dependencies for Leiningen 2 (wheezy currently has 1.7.1 which is outdated) this will allow Debian to incorporate more Clojure programs and libraries into it's package system. The second part is to write tools to ease the packaging of software made with Leiningen and Clojure.
