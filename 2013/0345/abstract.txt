We propose to develop a package extension to incorporate block structure into the Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) for ERGM package. We have three block models and each is under different dependence assumption among edges or homogeneous assumption among network structures. The goal of block model is to better fit network data and reduce degeneracy which often occurs in traditional ERGMs. The extension will have both R and C implementations. We hope to provide an efficient and convenient interface for researcher in social network analysis research.
