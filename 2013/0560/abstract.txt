The acquisition stage of a GNSS receiver is in charge of detect the set of visible satellites and provide a first coarse estimation of some essential parameters for synchronization. This process requires a blind search that limits significantly the sensitivity of the whole receiver operation. The goal of this project is to implement high sensitivity acquisition algorithms for both GPS L1 and Galileo E1 signals.
