I propose to make an iOS app for vcell users to be able to carry out operations on vcell server using the provided API. The app will contain three tabs, first tab listing all jobs, second tab listing all simulations and third tab listing all models. Each tab will have various actions associated with them. A user needs to authenticate to use all the features of the app otherwise actions allowed for public usage will be available to the user.
