The Shiny package allows for easy creation of interactive web graphics from R objects. Bioconductor packages have many objects that represent biological data or results. For each of these Bioconductor objects, there exists a typical set of visualizations to help users explore their data. Normally, these visuals are replotted several times until certain parameters are tweaked to show the image in a way that conveys a specific insight. This project pairs these standard Bioconductor objects with more user-friendly Shiny visualizations via new display() methods.
