Video Sequence Editor will be redesign to be closely integrated with the rest of Blender while having cleaner API. Underlying structure will be significantly modify for cleaner and optimizable code. To achieve better playback performance, multithreading will be employed with later gpu extension . Also it will share compositor nodes for effects and transitions. It will have updated fast visualization.. I will add video preview (with playback) into file browser and strips (many snapshots) for easier feedback. Dynamic slow motion might be also implemented.
