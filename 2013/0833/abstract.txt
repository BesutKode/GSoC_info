Efficiency of calculations is of major importance in modern computing. With the advent of the cloud computing model, the performance of computational software has turned into an even more critical factor that greatly affects the decisions made by the various stakeholders. In this project we aim at providing the uBlas project with efficient algorithms that will allow for high performing mathematical functions taking advantage of vector instructions and parallel execution.
