The main idea is to develop an intuitive tool to read-process-display online data sources, available from geo-data portal. The tool will be able to decode the get capabilities and execute spatio temporal queries on netcdf resources. All processing will be done in python using PyOSSIM, while PlanetSasha will be used as a frontend.
