The DIFFER application is today a full-fletched validator that compares and validates images in different formats. It is powerful because it takes advantage of many excellent tools to create an assembled report for each image analysed. My proposal includes several new features for the application that will further enhance its strengths and open up new possibilities for its users. Ideas include: a new report engine that exports to PDF and Excel, implementation of thumbnails and a documentation overhaul.
