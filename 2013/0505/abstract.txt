Scaffold hunter is a tool used in the life-science department for the analysis of (large) data-sets. Currently it has the following views: the scaffold-tree, a way to hierarchical classify molecular data sets. A table view, a dendrogram and a simple 2d or 3d plot. This proposal writes about a plan to extend scaffold-hunter with two more views. The first part of this proposal explains the plan on how to do this, the second half talks about the already known knowledge of the proposer.
