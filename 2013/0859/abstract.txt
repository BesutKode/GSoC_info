Emacsy is an embeddable Emacs-like library aimed at non-textual applications.  Emacsy is the Emacs OS minus the text editor.  Its aim is to provide the following features: keymaps, minibuffer, recordable macros, history, tab completion, major and minor modes, and a comprehensive online help system.  And make these features easy to integrate into any interative C/C++ application.  Emacsy is not a text editor.  Emacsy is an attempt to bring the Emacs way of doing things to other applications natively.
