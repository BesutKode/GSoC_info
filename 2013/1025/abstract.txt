There are currently no GUI toolkits that properly support PyPy.  Although the existing wxPython and Tkinter implementations have some partial compatibility, they are supported via the CPython extension emulation layer.  The goal of this project will be to create wxPython bindings which are compatible with PyPy.  These bindings will use the CFFI library to interface with the native code and will be based off of wxPython Phoenix, a work-in-progress re-write of the original bindings.
