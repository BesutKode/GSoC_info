The Patient Matching Module currently provides a means of selecting patient characteristics and properties for creating a matching strategy. We have a set of statistics-gathering methods we can run on a set of data to give us what are called "field metrics". A subject matter expert can look at these metrics and tell us which fields are best for matching. With the latest work in this field, we can now predict what an expert would suggest using a random forest of decision trees.
