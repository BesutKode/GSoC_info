The RichFaces project offers various components for the JSF framework; moreover it contains the Component Development Kit, which eases the developing process of new components. There are currently no chart plotting component in the RichFaces component library.

The aim of the project is to create a chart component supporting multiple chart types, user interaction and event handling. The component will expose a javascript library with a smooth API completed by examples of usage, documentation and an Arquillian based test suite.
