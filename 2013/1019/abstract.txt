The BioAuth Moodle Plugin will utilize behavioral biometrics recorded during quiz attempts in order to verify the identity of online test takers. Instructors will be able to confirm or dismiss suspicions of cheating students and respond appropriately. The first release of the BioAuth Plugin will analyze keystroke dynamics and linguistic patterns in short essay questions, using recent breakthroughs in behavioral biometric authentication. The workflow of existing courses will not be affected, allowing a seamless integration for institutions who wish to adopt this technology and ensure academic integrity.
