This is a proposal to continue updating the way Blender draws to the screen. Blender relies on an older version of the OpenGL graphics library that is no longer fully supported by hardware providers. For this reason, when new generations of graphics cards are released, Blender will not fully benefit from the increases in capability and performance. In addition, new mobile devices show every indication of becoming the primary means by which most people use computers. For this reason, Blender and its game engine should be made to work with OpenGL ES, which was designed for those kinds of systems.
