R is increasingly being used in Biodiversity information analysis. There are several R packages like rgbif and rvertnet to query, download and to some extent analyze the data within R workflow. We also have packages like dismo and SDMTools for modeling the data. Proposed visualizations would be helpful to understand completeness of biodiversity inventory, extent of geographical, taxonomic and temporal coverage, gaps and biases in data. We propose to develop a package to fill in this gap.
