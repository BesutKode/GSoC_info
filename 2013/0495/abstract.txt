The project includes a interesting idea to build a libdrizzle-redux api based module to help replicate data from MySQL to Drizzle (Row based replication will be used). But currently most web applications owner uses MySQL, as either they don't know about drizzle power or they already deployed their application on MySQL. With this project Web Application owner can take advantages of both MySQL and Drizzle as they can keep their old MySQL features and at the same time can use drizzle plugins to implement new and faster feature with this drizzle replicated database.
