MediaGoblin is currently used as free platform for media publishing programs. A large number of users constantly upload media and hence having a blogging system will enable them to brag about the content that they add. I propopse to add blogging system to MediaGoblin as a separate plugin by reusing components such as MediaEntry, MediaTag, Collection etc from the existing infrastructure. With a blogging system, MediaGoblin can be used as an alternative to tumblr. I also propose to implement oEmbed protocol to provide embedding support in MediaGoblin.
