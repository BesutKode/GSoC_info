Project goal is to create PyGMO servers cloud with xmpp as a transport layer. Users of the cloud would be able to control, send, execute and monitor the execution of optimalization tasks remotely, using Google Talk. Cloud itself would be able to balance load of nodes, and would take care about the job execution issues (timeouts/interrupts/data loss etc).  The appropriate communication protocol would be created, dealing with both the communication between nodes and between users and nodes.
