This project aims at modelling biological systems in a Statechart dialect of Java and applying model checking techniques to verify properties of interest such as stabilization or consistency with respect to a set of laboratory experimental observations.  In particular, the project will focus on the C. elegans roundworm, which is a model organism extensively used in biological research because of its simplicity and tractability.  The project will provide implementations for the particular composition operator and abstractions used in these models.  The tool to be developed should be simple, intuitive and user-friendly in order to actually be useful for biological researchers.
