This project aims to create R Interactive Graphics via HTml (RIGHT) package that enables
interactive data visualization and analysis on a
variety of platforms. RIGHT will provide a seamless analysis-visualization workflow in R and allow users to easily explore data
and gain valuable insight for the subsequent analysis. For example, the user can
highlight the relation among visual elements in multiple plots in
a figure, or selectively remove outlier points and re-analyze the
updated data either locally or remotely.  Since HTML5 canvas and
JavaScript will be used to create the visualization, it can be delivered to virtually any
device/platform with a modern web browser. RIGHT will become a
valuable tool for understanding large amounts of data, hence turning them into knowledge.
