The user may enter a large variety of entries, and the program with parse it to fit the users need. For example, the user may use a domain of words and visualize the length of those words with just two lines of code. The nice thing about Graph-ET is that it’s very simple to see results also the interface allows the user the play with their charts in a
variety of ways. The idea is having a kind of EyeSee but with Roassal as rendering and adding more power of desition to the user.


Graph-ET is a software that needs to draw to work, for that it mainly uses Object Profile’s Roassal to make the drawing and the interaction work.
