I propose to implement a visual management tool, with component drag and drop capabilities. Implementation will be done in C++ and Qt. Users would be able to add their own components and form personal "libraries" (in which they can load behaviours or even modify component code). The GUI will be able to generate the DSL code and even deploy the components; it will also provide input to the components and plot observable output parameters in order to improve the testing experience.
