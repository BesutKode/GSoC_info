My idea is to develop the existing simpleCV javascript skeleton library into a fully functional computer vision library which is user-friendly and excels in performance. Basically i will be adding coffeescript analogs of the classes and methods in simpleCV to the existing library. I also intend to improve the user interface and optimize the speed of execution and ensure code quality at every point.
