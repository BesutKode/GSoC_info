Function/Pathway annotation for an existing network/gene set is an essential step for network/gene set analysis. Although current version of CyThesarures theoretically can annotate network with several steps, itâ€™s not yet convenient enough and lack of supporting to customized database. A one step function/pathway annotation function will be not only a complement of CyThesarures, but also a potentially useful service for all other function/pathway analysis Apps, such as Bingo, Mosaic, NOA and so on.
