As the title Suggests, the aim of the project is to improvise the existing features built by me and others. My previous Summer of Code resulted in Pivot Tables. So the aim is to improve User Interface for Pivot Tables by making it more intuitive and easy to use. Subsequently, to enhance the use of Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts will be developed to better visualize the summarized data. Thirdly,features like Rich Text editing in Cells, Undo/Redo Command for Insertion/Deletion for Rows/Columns, Prediction based Autocomplete feature would be added to save a lot of time while entering & editing data in sheets. Fourthly, the above features would also be tried to be implemented in Kexi as it has some similarities with Sheets and can support Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts and Autocompletion.
