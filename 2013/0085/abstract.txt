Built on top of Trac, Apache Bloodhound is a software project management application recently released on the market. The main features of the application include multiple projects management, ease of installation and a user-friendly interface. It reduces the effort of tracking projects by providing a clean interface to connect revision control with wiki content and a bug database. 

Being able to reference tickets or other objects in a clear, nice manner would a great feature for the application, as many users share content on external websites. Posting a plain link requires other users to follow it individually, which isnâ€™t very engaging for them. Also, posting the static content of the objects is not a good solution as the states of the object change very often, and the description becomes outdated.
