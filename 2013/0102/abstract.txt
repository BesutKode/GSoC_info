Inkscape has a variety of tools that suffice for most graphic designersâ€™ work. Having worked with Adobe Illustrator (and related products like CorelDraw, Photoshop etc) since middle school before making the switch to Inkscape, places me in a position where I can judge what is missing as a designer and what is possible as a developer ( owing to my undergraduate studies ).
I propose to create a revamped tool for editing solid-colored objects selected on the Canvas and forming Color Themes. The tool shall provide interactive color- editing which is very useful for professional designers and novice alike. Elements of basic Color Theory will be integrated in the tool to aid scheme based color grouping. For a clearer picture please visit:

The tool will be an improvement over the 'Wheel' widget in the 'Fill and Stroke' Dialog Box.
