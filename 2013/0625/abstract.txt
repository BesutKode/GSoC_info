The first implementable draft of the upcoming version of the HyperText Transer Protocol (HTTP/2) becomes available by early summer. The proposed project is about implementing an early prototype server for this experimental protocol in JavaScript (node.js) by the end of the summer with emphasis on well documented code and verbose debugging output. Having an early prototype server that is well documented, and logs very verbosely (frame-by-frame if needed) could be useful for developing client software for the HTTP/2 protocol. It could help engineers at Mozilla to prototype HTTP/2 support for Firefox, and could provide feedback for the HTTP working group (e.g. discovering ambiguities in the text, etc.).
