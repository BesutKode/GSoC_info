While ScummVM has support for direct input mode for touchscreen devices, many of the controls using this mode feel awkward due to them being optimized for mouse/keyboard usage. This project aims to create a beautiful looking user interface that can be navigated on a smaller screen with fingers, focusing on landscape mode, on modern touchscreen devices. The goal is to make ScummVM feel like a native application without sacrificing too much functionality.
