This project aims to remodel the pidgin codebase around the GObject. I believe that this transition will benefit the code by making it cleaner, more robust and object-oriented. GObjectification would result in a more modern codebase that is not only more maintainable, but will also lift some of the restrictions developers currently face. The proposal also introduces an intuitive GObject-based plugin API, and a protocol interface that protocol plugins must implement.
