The project goal is to improve MIDI import in MuseScore by implementation of several different features that will be useful for conversion MIDI files to music notation. It is important possibility to import MIDI files recorded with other software. There is no one-to-one conversion from MIDI to music notation in general but the conversion process can be made more accurate. I hope this project will help to improve MIDI import operations in MuseScore and make user work with the program more effective.
