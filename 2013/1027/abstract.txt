This is detailed proposal where I explain my main ideas for CERN Android application. I specify how I plan on making the application extensible, how I've planned to organise it and how I think it'll be most convenient way to code it. I refer to existing iOS app, extending and modyfing some ideas. I present both development details and thought process behind them as well as detailed timeline and description of my experience and background.
