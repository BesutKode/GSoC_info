In this project,  we will examine novel ways to create an environment to display a patient's medical records and medical history. Currently patient medical records are resemble ugly reciepts straight from the 80s. In this project, we will help develop a timeline view (as in facebook timeline) of a patients complete medical history. When completed, it should allow a patient to see their entire medical history as a timeline with medications, treatments etc.
