The Eclipse Array Explorer developed by CVAST at TU Wien University is a powerful tool created to make visualizing arrays and collections in the Eclipse Debugging framework easy. The explorer gives several options to replace the standard Eclipse framework. In its current state, the plug-in is powerful, but it needs to be updated in order to allow for widespread usage and adoption of the plugin by the Eclipse community. I feel that this plugin can easily be updated to become an even more powerful tool able to handle large arrays, collections, and maps.
