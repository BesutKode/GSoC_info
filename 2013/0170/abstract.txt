The Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) can be used to plan paths for robots in environments with dynamics. The Modular OpenRobots Simulation Engine (MORSE) is an add-on for Blender that allows the user or other code to direct a robot in a realtime physics simulation. There is an opportunity to enhance both the functionality of MORSE and the user accessibility of OMPL by combining the two. This enables modeling, solving, and simulating a planning problem from the same interface.
