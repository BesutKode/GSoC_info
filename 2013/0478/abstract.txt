Project involves computation of hypervolume in higher dimensional spaces for a set of
hypercubes sharing one common point (reference point that strictly dominates the whole
set). It is a geometrical interpretation of quality measure for a Pareto set. It can be used
as a comparison between two population of individuals, and as a fitness function during
the evolution phase in the genetic algorithm. First scenario allows for exact computation,
since time is not as crucial of a factor, as it is in second case (executing hypervolume
computation during the algorithm). This requires implementation of both exact and
approximated methods. Additionally, few methods have been proposed that
use hypervolume as a input for the fitness measure. I intend to implement at least one of
them during the GSoC as well.
