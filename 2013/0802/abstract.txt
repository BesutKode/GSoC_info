MNE-Python implements time domain beamformers for imaging sources of brain activity recorded with M/EEG. The goal of this project is to extend the beamformer module to support frequency domain implementations. It will involve implementing computation of cross-spectral density in consecutive time windows, refactoring current beamforming code as well as preparation of examples and tests for the time-frequency beamformer functionality.
