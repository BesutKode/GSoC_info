AContent provides three types of templates (theme, layout and structure) that can be used to create contents and these templates are mostly html, css and xml scripts. Currently the only way to create or edit a template is to manually write the scripts using a text editor which is not convenient. The purpose of this project is to provide the administrator with a GUI tool to create new templates and integrate it to the admin panel of AContent. Using this tool admin should be able to create, modify and delete all three types of templates.
