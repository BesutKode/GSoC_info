The aim of the project is to develop a rigorously tested, well documented collaborative 
filtering framework for mlpack with a flexible API. The project involves defining the 
input/output model, implementing collaborative filtering algorithms and deriving various 
recommendations from the data. The project aims to give maximum user control 
and freedom to the user to work with the algorithms. 
The algorithms proposed in this proposal include QUIC-SVD and ALS-WR
