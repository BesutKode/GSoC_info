In this proposal, I hope to implement repeating table header, a feature that allows Abiword's Table to repeat a selected row as header on top of each page that the table is broken over. Some of Table features have been implemented on branches "gsoc2010tableimprov", I should merge them firstly. some major works:
1. the backend work about Table header
2. Frontend work to display the table header on the top of every page 
3. fix the table dialog (or Menu) to enable the user to use the feature
4. Merge branches "gsoc2010tableimprov" for some table features 
5. More testing means more guarantee.

I have built Abiword on both Windows and Linux.

I also have fixed bug http://bugzilla.abisource.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8487

I also make some contribution about Chinese Translation.
