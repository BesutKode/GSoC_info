Implement a disambiguation framework for Apertium that can be expressed as a finite-state transducer (FST). The framework will be based on the constraint grammar (CG) formalism, which is already supported by Apertium. There exists already a proof-of-concept compiler that converts CG rules to FSTs using: fomacg. This project will extend fomacg to handle all CG constructs and implement program that runs the rule FSTs on the output of Apertium's morphological analyzer component.
