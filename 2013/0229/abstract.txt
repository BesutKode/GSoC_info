Image segmentation algorithms, specifically Graph-cut are a top priority for inclusion in scikit-image. Additionally, although the barrier to entry for GPU computing how lowered significantly and image-processing being a natural application of GPGPU, the scikit-image project has remained a CPU-only library. This project aims to conduct a feasible study for the inclusion of OpenCL by comparing the performance of CPU and GPU versions of the segmentation algorithms Graph-cut, Grow-cut and QuickShift
