This proposal focuses on improving Substance D application server in several aspects. The goal is to improve code base and make project more interesting to future user base. Work is focused on three areas: merging deform_bootstrap with deform into deform2, writing/improving documentation and creating a migration helpers for importing content from Plone. Any extra time will be spent on features that will be coordinated with mentor(s).
