Wiselib supports a variety of target platforms (including different WSN hardware platforms, Android, Linux, iOS, and the Shawn simulator). This requires a very complex, error-prone, and time-consuming installation and configuration of all required tools and components to help developers work productivity. To ease this process, the goal of this project is to implement a cloud service for editing Wiselib code. Users just need to create an account and work on their fork of wiselib (or the original repository) to edit their code and collaborate with their colleagues. The service shall be designed as a RESTful web-based editor and use a remote compilation service for compilation on a subset of Wiselib platforms.
