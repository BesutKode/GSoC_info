As RDM enabled devices become more prevalent and the need to access RDM information becomes a more common, it is important to have a tool for those new to RDM, and thus unfamiliar with the standard, to be use to send and receive RDM messages. This summer I will use Pythonâ€™s TKinter package to create a graphical user interface that will send and receive RDM messages using OLA. My UI, unlike the existing RDM control software, will be compatible with many RDM controllers and not limited controllers created by a specific manufacturer. In addition, my user interface will aim to give the user useful information with as few steps as possible.
