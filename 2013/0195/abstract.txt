The purpose of this project will be to provide a stand-alone graphical interface that will allow a user to launch Dr. Memory, configure command-line parameters, and view the report, in an intuitive and easy to use manner. 

It will also provide an interface for visualizing the data presented by Dr. Heapstat. It will incorporate the features provided by the old tool, but will also aim to add a few features as well.
