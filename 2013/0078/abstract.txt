SfePy is a well known python package for solving systems of coupled partial differential equations (PDEs) by the finite element method in 2D and 3D. Currently it is used for solving problems related to porous media convection, acoustics, incompressible flows and various other engineering problems. My goal is to make the solver even stronger by adding capabilities to tackle convection-diffusion and phase change phenomena.
