This project proposal defines an algorithm to infer from the searching habits of an user on a particular website to find whether a search engine exists on that site. It can then suggest the user to add the search engine to the list of search engines by automatically inferring the search forms and queries. It would respect other policies like Private Browsing and Clear Search Data.
