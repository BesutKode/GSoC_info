I propose a mobile application and back-end management system to help scientists and science teachers manage data collection and improve real-time communication during a scientific field study. On one hand, the web application is designed for planning a trip and analyzing collected data after a trip. The mobile application is specially designed for real-time communication and event-tracking in a field study. The user will be able to track other team memberâ€™s location, data collection status, and share information with other team members in a customized map view interface.
