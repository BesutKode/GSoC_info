Wants to learn about parser first (libgpo), then 
Create thread upon startup
Use parser to check for anything important to Samba
If so, update database, else continue scanning.
Only take meaningful information. 
Lots of testing. 
Multithreading for efficiency?

Note: Just heard about summer of Code recently. Highly interested, did not have luxury of having a lot of time, had done research on Samba - Very interested.
