I will expand the multi-objective capabilities of PaGMO. At the moment  only two algorithms for multi-objective optimization are available (NSGA-II, IHS). The aim of this project is to extend the library of multi-objective optimization algorithms including algorithms like MOEA/D, Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization, Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm, Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm and  Pareto Adaptive Îµ-Dominance
