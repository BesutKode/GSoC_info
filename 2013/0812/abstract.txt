A codon alignment is an alignment of nucleotide sequences in which trinucleotides correspond directly to amino acids in translated product. Codon alignment is useful as it distinguished different types of nucleotides substitution and is frequently used to test neutrality and calculate selection pressure. My job in the project is to develop codon alignment support for biopython. This will facilitate quick and large scale evolutionary analysis in biopython environment.
