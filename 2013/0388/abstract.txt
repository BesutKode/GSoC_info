The aim of this project is to provide an more effective mechanism to provision users from LDAP into cloudstack.  Currently cloudstack enables LDAP authentication.  In this authentication users must be first setup in cloudstack.  Once the user is setup in cloudstack they can authenticate using their ldap username and password.  This project will improve Cloudstack LDAP integration by enabling users be setup automatically using their LDAP credentials.
