The NDT is a network performance and configuration testing tool that provides advanced diagnostic information to the user. The current client that runs in web browsers is a Java Applet. But as browsers are increasingly removing Java support due to security issues, I intend to convert this Java client into a Flash client that will perform 5 diagnostic tests, the Client-to-Server throughput test, the Server-to-Client throughput test, the Middlebox test, the Simple Firewall test and the META test and make the results of these tests available both on-screen and through JavaScript accessor methods.
