The project will create a stable and improved version of the OpenTripPlanner (OTP) Android client, since the current client version crashes frequently. The client should allow walk, bike and transit routing. Improvements of the client will extend current basic capabilities by accessing OTP server functions such as bike routing parameter setting, and selection of different route types (fastest, shortest, fewest transfers, flattest). Also functions that allow to explore stops (using OSM data) and transit network information, such as the display of complete routes, are new features that should be worked on.
