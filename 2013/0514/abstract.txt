The project consists in using clang's static analyzer (C, C++, Objective-C) on Debian packages to help developers find bugs that compilers are not able to find. scan-build can detect a large range of oddities in the code from dead assignments (a clean up is always something worthy) to null pointer dereferencement or weird malloc/free scenarios. This is a process that could be integrated into Debian quality assurance workflow, to ensure stability for end users and remove bugs even before uploading packages to the archive (such as other daca tools or lintian checks).
