The KernelStrider tools collect information about the memory accesses and function calls that the target kernel module makes. The information is passed to the user space for further processing. Since the amount of data generated in the kernel space is large enough, that requires more computing power to successfully transfer that data from the kernel. It is clean that we need to apply some compressing methods at the kernel side and some decompressing methods when captured data is being processed.
