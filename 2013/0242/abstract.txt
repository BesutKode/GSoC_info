Hello,
I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Piraeus, Greece, Dept. Of Computer Science.I'm using Java as my primary language for the last year.Writing a Quickstart would be a great way to begin contributing to the community as it combines a deep
understanding of the underline technology and the ability to demonstrate pragmatic results and not the default "Hello World".
