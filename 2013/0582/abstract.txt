The aim for this project is to gather information about genes scattered around different sites across the web. This is done by selecting parts of the web page which are to be extracted and then present the data for a large list of genes. The goal for this summer is to make the annotation process more robust, the web crawling more reliable and to create an interface for accessing the data.
