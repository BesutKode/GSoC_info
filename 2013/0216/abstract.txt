A mailing list's member's area is typically the user's "dashboard". It allows him/her to configure their mailing lists, subscribe or unsubscribe to lists and basically control every aspect of their subscription. While mailman provides a lot of functionality for creating and maintaining mailing lists, the basic interface that the user is faced with is un-intuitive at best. Regular users will eventually learn to use the mailing list but new users, especially those who are accustomed to dynamic, responsive and interactive webpages will find it quite difficult. Powerful systems need to be coupled with simple interfaces that enable users to get the most out of the community. Please go to http://roughroughbook.blogspot.in/ to view the mockup.
The proposed interface builds on top of existing Mailman and WebKitty modules.
