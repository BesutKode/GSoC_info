With the rapid development of positioning technology and imaging technology, the scale of spatial data has shown to have a exponential growth. There are two major challenges for managing and querying these massive spatial data: the multi-dimensional structure of spatial data and the high computational complexity of spatial queries. The rapid growth of spatial data requires a fast query system. In this project, we will present Hadoop-GIS by extending Apache Hive, a MapReduce based data warehousing system with spatial query capabilities. The main goal of Hadoop-GIS is to develop a highly scalable, cost-effective, efficient and expressive integrated spatial query processing system for data and compute intensive spatial applications, that can take advantage of MapReduce running on commodity clusters.
