The technical basis for GXml was established over the past two years, and now it's time to add some finishing touches for a 1.0 release.  The main focus is porting an existing application from libxml2 to GXml to drive documentation and bug discovery and produce a series of articles to accompany existing documentation guiding.  Time permitting, addition of a SAX parser or an XPath query interface will be prototyped.
