This document is my proposal for working for GNU Prolog For Java. I would be rewriting the parser such that it supports UTF-8. The parser needs to be rewritten as the old javacc code doesnâ€™t compile to working java in modern javaccs. The parser may throw errors or become non-terminating if unicode occurs in it's input. Extensive testing has to go in tandem with the change in code of the parser to make it better.
