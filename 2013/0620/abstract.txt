"ImageStats" is a web-based tool to collect facial and skin annotations from images. The collected data is used as established ground truth information to develop and improve face-detection and face-matching algorithms. It is developed at National Library of Medicine (NLM) to help R&D in the field of image processing. 
ImageStats was rapid-prototyped from a number of open source components, among them Vesuvius, GWT, GXT, GWT-Graphics, Tomcat, Mysql, and SOLR. The current implementation is very much complicated in terms of structure and has a number of dependencies. The motive of this project is to reimplement ImageStats in a simpler manner so as to make the application open source and standalone. This will make the application open to other open source developers for improvements and changes.
