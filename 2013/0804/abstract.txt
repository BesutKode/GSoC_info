Many of the web pages in http://www.google-melange.com consists of lists. The list of accepted organizations, the list of accepted GSoC projects and published GCI tasks are lists that are publicly view-able. Other than those there are many lists that can be viewed by students, mentors, organization admins and program admin. Some of these lists contains thousands of items. This project aims to improve the user experience and performance of those lists.
