Linked Data describes a method of publishing structured which
   can be interlinked and makes data more useful.These are not
   intended to serve web pages rather they are used to share information between
   computers so that they can read and interpret easily. RDF,
   designed as meta data model is and has been used for Linking
   Data. One of the profound examples of its use can be seen in Facebook's
   Open Graph. The aim of my project is to conclude the final stages
   of JSON-LD [JSON - Linked - Data] [based upon JSON, as the name
   suggests] by making Schema's, Context, Applications that show
   JSON to JSON-LD conversions etc. JSON-LD is a light weight JSON-Linked
   Data that provides context to a data.
