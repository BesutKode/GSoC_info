My idea is to create a plugin that aids the user of PathVisio in pathway creation by automating the process of connecting data nodes based on knowledge from different data sources such as interaction databases and text mining of literature.
The user will be able to provide a list of data identifiers(representing e.g. gene products and metabolites).The plugin will create data nodes based on this input and it will make use of the “pathwayLoom” plugin (http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.97001) to look for possible connections between these nodes. After the nodes are connected a pathway will be drawn in a way that is clear and understandable for the user.
