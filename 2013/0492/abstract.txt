The current generation of profile management tools for AppArmor are either quite bug-ridden or no longer maintained. This calls for a fresh re-write of the tool, which plays a crucial role in defining the set of rules used by AppArmor for the various applications across platforms. Besides aiming to be a better implementation of the profile management tool we also seek to provide an added functionality to merge profiles and also get an online repository back alive.
