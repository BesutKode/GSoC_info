One of the most-compelling features of Ruby on Rails when it was first released was its console that allowed direct interaction with the application. It would be useful to extend this ability to a browser to aid development and testing in situations where direct shell access isn't available. I would also like to make it available on the default error pages with the context of the error, as I find this extremely useful while debugging.
