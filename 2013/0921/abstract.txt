MTP is the official way to manage files on millions of recent Android devices. The MTP support in Amarok will be completely rewritten under this project, drastically simplifying the design, using up-to-date technologies and future-proofing the support with recent advances of Linux MTP stack in mind. It will also allow for a deprecated framework to be removed from Amarok and will add new features like on-the-fly transcoding.
