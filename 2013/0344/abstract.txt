The proposal consists in improve the current post-processing engine, decouple the SSDO effect from the Deferred Render Manager, and implement three effects: Screen Space Ambient Occlusion, Depth of Field and Motion Blur, each one with a demo application and documentation. The main objective is to make these effects easy to use and integrate in CrystalSpace projects and its main demos.
