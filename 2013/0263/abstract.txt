VXQuery has create a parallel XQuery processor, yet there is no benchmark to show how well it performs. In order to show the power of a parallel implementation XQuery, a benchmark and framework shall be set up using a a set of queries to test the parallel execution. The set of queries shall outline the strengths and weaknesses  of using VXQuery's implementation. The framework should return measurement details for determining performance.
