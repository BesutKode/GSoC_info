The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Internationalization (i18n) Checker aids web developers in the creation of language-sensitive web pages, embodying the W3C’s objective of “making the web world-wide”. As it stands, the PHP code that comprises the validation and summary is integrated into the logic of the web service. The purpose of this project is to bring the i18n Checker up to date with its counterpart validators by rewriting it in Java, and separating the validation logic into an API.
