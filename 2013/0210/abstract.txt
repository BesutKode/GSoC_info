Emacs XWidgets is an experimental branch to enable embedding GTK
  widgets inside an Emacs window. For example, this permits Emacs to
  render HTML pages with WebKit.

  The goal of this project is to improve the current implementation by
  converting C code to Elisp code and to work on the GObject
  introspection integration.

  My mentor for this project will be Joakim Verona, the developer of
  this branch.
