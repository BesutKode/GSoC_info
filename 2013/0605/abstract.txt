This proposal aims to improve the refactoring support of the Scala IDE. Right now refactorings on Scala code are not connected to refactorings on Java code - this may lead to problems in projects with a mixed codebase in Scala and Java. The main goal is to provide a reliable crosslanguage version of the 'Rename' refactoring. Additional goals are to extend the Rename refactoring to Play framework templates and routing files in the Scala IDE Play plugin.
