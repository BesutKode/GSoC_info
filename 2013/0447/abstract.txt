I will work using Apertium platform on the Danish-Norwegian (Bokm√•l) language pair  that's currently in the nursery stage. I will make a set of transfer rules and work on a constraint grammar to improve the tagging process. I will mainly do work on the nb-da direction as I can make reliable grammaticality judgments, Danish being my first language. I also plan to extend support to nn-da (Nynorsk-Dansh)
