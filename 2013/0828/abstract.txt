Currently KDE doesn't have any built-in tools to configure touchpad. It's strange when even lightweight desktops like XFCE can at least configure touchpad without any third-party applications.
I want to implement:
1) System Settings module for touchpad configuration
2) Plasmoid that will allow enabling/disabling touchpad
3) Daemon that automatically disables touchpad when external mouse is plugged in
