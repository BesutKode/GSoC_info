Apache ManifoldCF is a framework which facilitate connecting source content repositories to target repositories so that indexing and searching of content can be done. There are different types of content in different repositories. ManifoldCF use repository connectors to connect these different types of content repositories. But yet ManifoldCF does not have a email connector. But emails carry a great importance in present enterprise. So it will be very elegant to have a email connector for ManifoldCF. This proposal is to implement a Email connector for ManifoldCF framework.
