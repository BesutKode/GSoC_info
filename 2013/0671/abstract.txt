Provide a framework for repeatedly measuring the performance of DUNE. I will write a number of small example programs to be used as benchmarks. A test running environment will compile and run these benchmark while measuring the spent time and consumed resources. While the tests will be run on many computers, the results will be reported to a central dashboard that will analyze the data and visualized on a website.
