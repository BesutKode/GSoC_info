I want to build a testbed for ooniprobe in a small, medium or even big network of potentially malicious nodes that censor and/or manipulate traffic.

The main goal will be to build a fast, easy-to-use and extensible tool that can verify the functionality of ooniprobe tests against a toolbox of known internet censorhip techniques.
