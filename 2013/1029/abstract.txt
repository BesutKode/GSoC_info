I'd like to create a more integrated and powerful descriptor archival search and browse system. (The current tools are very restrictive and the experience disjointed.) To do this, I'll write an archival browsing application wherein the results are interactive: they may act as further search filters. Together with a search string input tool which will have more filtering options, the application will provide a more cohesive archival browse & search experience and will be a more efficient tool.
