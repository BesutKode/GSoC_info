Many of models in science are based upon partial differential equations. In most cases, these equations are too complicated to solve exactly or even to approximate mathematically. To remedy this, we resort to using numerical methods. Scala's blend of object-oriented and functional programming paradigms provides a nice framework for working in, but it's main advantage is building libraries with an easy to use user iterface.
