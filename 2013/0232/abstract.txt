The SunPy package offers the module vso (Virtual Solar Observatory) which represents an interface to query and download astronomical data from multiple data providers simultaneously. This project will add a database interface for downloading data to save bandwidth if the same data is requested multiple times. It will also offer a handy way to group results which met certain conditions. Multiple conditions may be chained together using logical operators such as "and", "or", "not".
