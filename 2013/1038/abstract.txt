Mixxx, a popular free cross-platform DJ mixing software, currently has some features need to design and develop and some bugs need to fix. My proposal is to perfect the preset mapping workflow, as well as develop an api server for users to get presets from mixxx.org or other websites. Expect these two major tasks, I will try to implement software update manager and enhance Language options. Then, a series of tests in different platforms shall be performed. Finally,Some translation tasks,technical documents and manual shall be developed.
