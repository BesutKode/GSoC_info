The project proposes to build a set of Arduino-like libraries for development on the BeagleBone Black. The libraries will be available inside of the familiar Arduino IDE(along with multiple communication interfaces) or could also be installed as native libraries on the board. The underlying aim of the project is to make development on embedded Linux platforms easier and familiar to the Arduino environment.
