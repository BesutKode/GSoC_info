LDV tools are used to check Linux device drivers against several safety rules, each of which formally defines what is a correct usage of the particular part of kernel core API. Each rule also represents one or more typical misuses of the kernel core interfaces. By the moment, the framework contains about  30 formalized rules. This project is aimed at extending the number of rules supported by the framework.
