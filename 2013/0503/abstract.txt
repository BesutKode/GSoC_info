SnipMatch is a code snippet search tool which falls under Eclipse Code Recommenders. It will be extended as a social snippet sharing tool in which the contributors can create and share snippets with others. Current version of SnipMatch can work only locally with a local snippet repository. But this current SnipMatch version has many problems in architecture level and code level. My proposal is to rewrite SnipMatch code completion engine by eliminating the current drawbacks.
