Clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects, based on their similarity with other members of the group (cluster). In hard clustering, data is divided into distinct clusters, where each data element belongs to exactly one cluster.But in real applications, there is very often no sharp boundary between clusters, which makes it difficult to discretely assign objects to distinct clusters. Such scenarios require fuzzy clustering, which allows objects to belong to several clusters simultaneously, with different degrees of membership. The project deals with implementation of fuzzy clusters in cytoscape and their visualization.
