I want to make Inkscape an open-source electronics CAD tool. A schematics and PCB layout editor is not much more than a vector graphics editor with some special-purpose features. I want to implement these few special-purpose functions in Inkscape. The first steps are to add a component abstraction, a template feature and netlist generation. All these things will also be useful outside of electronics CAD. Inkscape will easily be the nicest electronics CAD tool out there^^
