The goal of this project is to create a functional prototype for a new Graphical User Interface Library for Processing. There is no core GUI system built into Processing as of date but some third-party GUI solutions exist. This project attempts to learn from and build on the existing libraries while keeping in mind the design principles that lie at the heart of Processing: Minimalism, accessibility and extensibility. Ultimately the aim is to spark discussion on what a core GUI library for Processing might encompass.
