In this year's GSoC, I'll contribute to shogun-toolbox, help the project by developing demos for all available algorithms in it. I've got a very strong knowledge and experience in website development and had learnt some machine learning curriculum, so I fit all the requirement of this idea. I am passionate with machine learning and shogun-toolbox, and have enthusiasm in open-source development. I'll devote myself to the project this summer for shogun!
