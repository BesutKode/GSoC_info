Current Pharo UI state of the art building is tightly coupled to the Morphic framework. Morphic, though flexible, has became aged and far from the experience a native interface can offer. Mars is cross-platform native user interface framework, which allows Pharo programmers to build modern user experiences. Mars currently is under heavy changes due to a big refactoring performed to allow multi-platform behavior, and most of its widgets need to be rebuilt, thought not entirely from scratch.
