Typed Lua is a superset of Lua with optional static typing and class based Object Oriented programming. Even though other scripting languages are already making efforts to have an optional type system, Lua still does not have much research on gradual typing. The aim of Typed Lua is to offer better documentation, compile-time type checking, and an Object Oriented programming style to Lua programmers. Typed Lua compiles to Lua code through a compiler, but also provides an API that programmers can embed in their text editors or IDEs.
