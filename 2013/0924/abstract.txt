Apache Airavata allows the registration of applications in a  global registry and then composing these applications to form a workflow. This is done in a Java based workflow composition service called Xbaya: which allows application registration, workflow composition, workflow execution and  monitoring. The project proposed here, on completion , looks to replace application registration and workflow composition UI provided by Airavata with one built with HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3.
