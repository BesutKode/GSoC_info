Description

SciSmalltalk is a new Smalltalk project, similar to existing scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy for Python or SciRuby for Ruby. SciSmalltalk already provide basic functionalities under MIT licence: complex and quaternions extensions, random number generator, fuzzy algorithms, LAPACK linear algebra package, Didier Besset's
numerical methods, ... We want to extend SciSmalltalk to solve ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations). SciSmalltalk is available here: https://github.com/SergeStinckwich/SciSmalltalk
