The goal of this project is to design a next-generation Intensive Care Unit monitoring visualization application that analyzes data streams in real-time and displays patient state. The focus will be on human interaction with the interface so that clinicians can intuitively comprehend trends and explore details. Population views will also be a part of this application to enable examination and assessment of trends and states of multiple patents across units or hospitals.

The web application will be based on the latest technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, WebSockets, AJAX), which are lightweight, asynchronous, real-time and portable. This will provide a next-generation toolset for clinicians to interact and assess patient state in intuitive ways. Professional coding practices will be followed so that the code is elegant and well-organized into MVC (or MV*) and can be easily extended by future developers.
