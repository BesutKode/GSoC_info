This document describes the project which is going to be implemented during the forthcoming Google Summer of Code 2013. The project's goal is to develop a cloud-based RESTful API for the tagin! location service, which would facilitate the development of location-based services and context-aware applications. The API would also help migrating the existing tagin! Android library to the cloud.
