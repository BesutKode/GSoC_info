The goal of this project is to extend the geo-profiling computational criminology projects. Previous work in this field uses a simple 2 dimensional spacial grid with x, y co-ordinates to move the agents. This project instead uses google maps api to make the agents move around as we validate various criminology theories like Distance Decay and Routine Activity. In the future these could be modeling in SIS when rendering is fully supported.
