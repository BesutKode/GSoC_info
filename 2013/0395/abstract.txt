XPath is used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document .XPath can be represented by XPath expressions and XPath engine is capable of parsing and evaluating the XPath over a Context. Jaxen and AxiomXPath are highly used XPath Engines. Currently available XPath Engines consume Object Model.Due to Construction of Object model and navigation on top of  a Model requires more memory and reduces performance on the other hand it consumes whole XML Stream when building Object Model and that problem is addressed here.
Since evaluation speed is more important in XPath processing, Implementing Xpath Engine on top of the XMLStream rather than on Object model will be a best solution for achieve high performance. So this project is proposed to  implement Xpath1.0 specification on top of the XMLStream .
