DynNetwork is an OSGi bundle developed by Sabina Sara Pfister as a 2012 GSOC project to provide support for importing, visualizing, and analysing dynamical networks in Cytoscape 3.0. This project would be an extension of the DynNetwork project. While DynNetwork allows dynamic networks to be imported from XGMML files, support for importing dynamic networks from spreadsheets would be a great addition. On the visualization side I feel the fish-eye lens would be a really cool feature to add. In addition to the above two features, I intend to implement the following features which would help the researchers greatly to analyse the networks: a) Graph metrics such as in-degree, out-degree, etc displayed graphically against time b) Dynamic attributes of a node/edge displayed as a timeseries graph.
