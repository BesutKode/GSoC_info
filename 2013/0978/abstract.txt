Currently Debian contains various applications for RTC, but there are problems when trying to make them work together. There are issues with NAT traversal, especially symmetrical NAT's and, of course, there is the problem of inter-program communication, there are various incompatibilities when trying to communicate between different types of clients. ICE/TURN/STUN are capable of traversing NAT/firewalls but the multitude of programs, protocols and fragmentation in general, will always pose problems. WebRTC promises to fix these problems and it has the potential to become the de facto standard in real time communication.
