Beeswarm currently has the Hive part operational, which mainly involves credential gathering. It now supports most of the largely used authenticated protocols. An important part of Beeswarm is the Beekeeper, which is a web app that processes the data that is gathered, and displays it. It is also the main frontend, which will (in the future) be able to deploy and configure multiple Hives and Feeders. This proposal aims to cover the development of Feeder and the Beekeeper (I am using the Beeswarm terminology here). Also, there could be a number of extensions to the Hive itself, as discussed below.
