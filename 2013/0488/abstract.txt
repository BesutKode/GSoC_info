Two years ago, as part of GSoC 2011, I started working on an implementation of composite fields as a means to support multi-column primary keys in models. While the project was successful, the timeframe wasn't sufficient to finish it and get it into a state where it could be merged into Django. This year I propose to take the last remaining steps for this project to be ready and hopefully even extend it with some extra features which were left out of the initial project.
