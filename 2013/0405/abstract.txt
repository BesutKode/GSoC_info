The goal of this project is to provide API written in Cython for generic access to Objective C classes and libraries. This will allow users to access anything in for example iOS API from Python. This is big feature for Kivy, and I am sure that Kivy with this feature will become more popular in area of development cross-platform applications, and this will open new way to access iOS from Python.
