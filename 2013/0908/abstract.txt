PDF.js component has been recently integrated into the Firefox browser. Where earlier rendering a pdf document required a third party software like Adobe Acrobat reader, this component brings a standard platform to parse and render PDF files within the web browser. The current proposal aims to improve the text layer in PDF.js. Some of the functionalities in the text layer is broken such as the improper behaviour of PDF.js during text selection, insertion of an extra ‘newline’ character in between the text when it is copy-pasted from PDF.js, rotation of pdf documents and highlighting of wrong text when searched using ‘find’. The project also involves improving text layer formatting like adding font styles italics, bold, h1 and height/width of the text in the document.
