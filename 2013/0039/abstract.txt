Previously Thug worked like a stand-alone tool and does not provide any way to distribute URL analysis tasks to different workers. For the same reason it was neither able to analyze difference in attacks to users according to their geolocation (unless it is provided a set of differently geolocated proxies to use obviously). Now after implementation of this project we are able to solve both problems by creating a centralized server which will be connected to all the Thug instances running across the globe and will distribute URLs (potentially according to geolocation analysis requirements). After that the clients will consume the tasks distributed by centralized server and will store the results in database after processing them.
