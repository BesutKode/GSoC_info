I propose to implement the Dialplan (PBX) generation for patient communication, as stated on the ideas page. The goal of my implementation is to make it as simple and easy as possible for the users to create the reminders, record messages and have calls deployed/dispatched automatically. In order to reach this goal, the additional feature of automatically dispatched calls should be inserted into the normal workflow of the user, seamlessly integrating into the existing system of program stages and the tracker API.
