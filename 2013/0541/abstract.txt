This summer I intend to write a new sound recorder application for the desktop. The app will be Gstreamer based, and will be written in GJS. I intend to make use of some of the new widgets in LibGd as well as some of the new GNOME 3 style Gtk+ widgets such as EggListBox. I am going to be using Giovanni Campagna's new Gtk JS app base as the basis of my application. As I work on the project I also intend to file bugs and give feedback about the GNOME/GJS developer experience.
