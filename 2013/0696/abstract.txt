My proposed idea for Funf.org is a combination of two ideas: (i) to build a framework for supporting probes to collect data from external peripheral devices, and (ii) to support high bandwidth probes, eg. photo, video and audio probes.

Although both ideas cannot be implemented in 3 months, I am looking forward to being assigned either one of the two projects, or a combination of the two. (See full proposal for details.)

Both of the ideas excite me, as they will provide a platform for accessing, storing, processing and uploading a range of data formats, from a variety of input devices/sensors. This will increase the reach of the Funf framework and enable a lot of interesting applications to built upon this platform.
