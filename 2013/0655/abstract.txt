I propose to develop a "smart" user interface, in the form of a user-openable tab, that allows the user to quickly and efficiently open new chats - based on who they chat with most often, and on what accounts they do so.

The user should be able to go from actively chatting in one conversation to doing so in a new one, losing no time in finding the contact to start the conversation with, refocusing to the correct UI element, or opening extra windows.
