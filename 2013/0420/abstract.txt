My name is Joshua Bonsink, a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Amsterdam. I propose to improve IMALSE by improving several aspects. Firstly the current background traffic generator is very simplistic. Integrating the traffic generator from SADIT will make the simulations more realistic. Secondly adding additional attacking scenarios will make the tool more useful. Finally a unified GUI system for all the aspects of IMALSE will make it more user-friendly.
