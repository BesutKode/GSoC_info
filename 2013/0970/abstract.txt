PyViennaCL will provide Python bindings for ViennaCL along with documentation and regression tests. The bindings will provide Pythonic objects and routines that represent the ViennaCL API, at least up to and including BLAS level 3. The bindings will also integrate coherently into the current Python scientific ecosystem, by supporting concurrent use of the NumPy ndarray, as well as aiming to provide a drop-in subset of the full NumPy API using ViennaCL as a back-end where possible.
