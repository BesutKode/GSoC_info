Recently INCF has launched the Dataspace - a platform to enable collaboration between researchers through the sharing of neuroscience data, text, images, sounds, movies, models and simulations. This platform is based on iRODS and physically integrates several data hubs, federated together. However, the INCF Dataspace is not the only system hosting neuroscience data. Several other data platforms are available, including the data management system developed at the German Neuroinformatics Node, which provides direct access to neuroscience data via a well-defined API. The aim of this project is to develop a client application that allows Dataspace users to search and access data at the G-Node, thus integrating available G-Node neuroscience data into the Dataspace federation.
