The current ODE solver in sympy was the work started by Aaron Meurer as his GSoC Project in 2009. The ODE solver though robust, has a good number of possible features that can be added. My project proposal would be dealing with the implementation of two of these features.

1. Solving non classifiable first order ODE using Lie Groups
2. Series Solutions to Second Order Homogeneous Differential Equations:
