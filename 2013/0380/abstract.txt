The Template Manager is an integral part of a CMS. It allows the end users to customize the look of their websites. The template manager should be intuitive and simple enough for a non-programmer to understand. The template manager has seen no major changes since Joomla 1.5. Ideally, the users should have full control over how their websites look. The goal of this project is to  dramatically modify the template manager and add functionalities keeping in mind the requirements of the end user as well as the developers.
