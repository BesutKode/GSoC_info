In this project, we will implement fast, accurate calculations of Bernoulli numbers for built-in types as well as multiprecision types. The Bernoulli numbers will subsequently be used for improving the existing implementation of gamma functions and adding brand new Boost.Math support for the polygamma function. If time permits, we'd like to add support for the Hurwitz zeta function an Bernoulli Polynomials.
