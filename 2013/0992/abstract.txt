My “ideal storage system” includes functionality to share and search for immutable documents (such songs or videos). The search results include objects that were generated in the system that contain partial data of the targeted file. These objects were generated independently of the initial user’s uploaded file. Later the user or someone who is searching for this content can use the new objects to recover the initial file. To make this thing possible it is necessary to locate these new objects. The search is conducted using CHK without any extra knowledge.
