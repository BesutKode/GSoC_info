Weave (http://oicweave.org)  is an open-source web-based visualization package implemented in Adobe Flex. The goal of the proposed work is to enable Weave to interface with an external graph rendering package in an interactive manner. By using an open source, third-party graph rendering engine, we will allow Weave users to visualize and interact with graphs of 10,000 nodes or more. By offloading some the bulk of the graph rendering to the server, and limiting the scope and detail of interaction, we could provide users with the ability to examine large graphs within the Weave framework. Cytoscape (http://cytoscape.org/) and Tulip (http://tulip.labri.fr/TulipDrupal/) are both candidates for third-party graph rendering engines to be used in this project.
