GNU Radio companion (GRC) is used to construct graphical flow-graphs. However, current GRC has several limitations. For example, it creates Python flow graphs only. Also, GRC provides little connection between a block and its underlying code. Finally, GRC work-flow needs improvement, e.g., as of now, development of new custom blocks is not considered in GRC. This project aims to allow i) access to Doxygen/Sphinx docs (and source code), ii) creation of a new block and editing it by maintaining a GRC project folder, iii) creation of C++ flow graphs from GRC flow graphs, all from within GRC.
