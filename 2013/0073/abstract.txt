This project aims to bring Reactome to the smartphones. Reactomeâ€™s REST API is quite diverse and exposes lots of data. This data can be utilized to develop a smartphone app which would allow users to access pathways and other data easily. The technology is advancing at a rapid rate and the count of smartphones is increasing everyday. A good app is necessary to allow users to access the data from anywhere. My objective is to develop a user friendly app which gives access to data anywhere. I will use jQuery mobile to design the UI and it will be wrapped into Phonegap to make it a native app.
