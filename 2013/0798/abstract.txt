IoTSyS uses oBIX (Open Building Information Exchange), an open standard for information exchange in building automation.
It provides a generic object model and defines ways to read, write and invoke operations on objects. oBIX also provides certain services, like watch, history and alarm services.
The current implementation is incomplete and only implements parts of the watch and history services.
In this project, I am going to fully implement the latest oBIX 1.1 Specification Working Draft.
