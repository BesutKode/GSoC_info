Drizzle 7.1 introduced a HTTP JSON server that allows clients to connect to Drizzle over HTTP, using a JSON based protocol. The 0.1 version still uses plain old SQL as the query language, embedded into the JSON structure. A work in progress also adds a pure json key-value protocol that supports HTTP PUT, POST, DELETE and GET operations. In this project you will further extend the functionality of the pure json protocol to also support querying of secondary indexes, ranges, etc.
