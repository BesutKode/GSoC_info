The project consists in setting up a framework for automated tests of Systers Mailman Project. The main goal of the project has been to have reusable and automated scripts for regression testing. 

The Pyunit test framework has been used. I have created  a series of web-based selenium webdriver scripts covering thoroughly the specific features added by Systers to the Mailman project. 

I have also created a collection of functions that serve to check if the data in the lists databases is being correctly modified while users perform web-based actions. The function are being used in conjunction with selenium scripts and smtplib/imaplib based functions to build a set of test cases that cover in a comprehensive way the functionalities of the Systers Mailman project.
