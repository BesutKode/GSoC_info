The basic idea of this project - building a fast, responsive search layer for medical data. Currently, the search layer in OpenMRS performs many unecessary checks before accessing the data. Our task is to bring that data into a lightweight node.js search layer. Before each database lookup, we must perform a quick check using the OpenMRS API to see if the user is allowed to view that particular resource.
