The ability of Neural networks to efficiently extract patterns can be used to provide a reliable method for forecasting solar storms. Similar systems have been successfully implemented for such purposes. This implementation will train three optimized neural networks using GOES satellite data. This will then be integrated with the C3 functionalities via the DCS framework. The result will be a reliable and robust warning system for Solar Storms.
