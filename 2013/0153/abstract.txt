CinC is a compiler written in clojure that can currently analyze and compile a subset of clojure.
It is based on the clojurescript compiler but it is not complete and it needs more work in order to be a viable alternative to Compiler.java.
With this project I'd intend to complete the CinC implementation in order to make it at least as powerful as Compiler.java is, and explore using multiple micro-passes in the analyzer, instead of keeping it a monolythic single-pass one, as the clojurescript one and Compiler.java are, in order to ease debugging and allow selective enabiling/disabling of analysys phases.

Extensive documentation will also be written for every part of the compiler.
