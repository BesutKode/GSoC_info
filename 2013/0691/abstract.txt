Qt is a framework which provides an immense amount of functionality to ease programming, and facilitate visualization. It serves to this purpose by offering several  generic tools such as widgets and frames, and its infamous signals/slots. Recently, Qt has integrated OpenGL into its system, and, hence, has made it easy to visualize not only in 2D, but also in 3D. OpenCV, at this moment, is lacking 3D visualization tools; however, this can conveniently be overcome by making use of Qt framework. This project aims to visualize SfM by integrating Qt+OpenGL into OpenCV.
