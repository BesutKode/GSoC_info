With the new Web Audio, Web MIDI, and Audio Data APIs, it is now viable to create sophisticated music software entirely using open web technologies. However, most current music-making software is complex, inaccessible to assistive technologies, and requires the use of a mouse. This project will involve the creation of a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) for making electronic music using the Flocking framework and Fluid Infusion.
