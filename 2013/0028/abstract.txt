AstroPy is an Open Source package for the analysis of astronomical data. It allready provides 
numerous features but up to now the functionatlity of the photutils package, which allows photometry on astronomical images, is still very limited. During GSoC2013 I plan to extend the photometry capabilities of AstroPy.
