While flashing SPI chips can be done externally with relative ease using flashrom, hardware to program FWH and LPC chips is beyond the reach of most enthusiasts. Cortex-M processors have become well-established in the open source community due to their low cost and extensive ecosystem. This makes them an ideal candidate for a universal ROM programmer. I propose a hardware/software/firmware ecosystem for a universal ROM programmer based on Cortex-M processors.
