With the advent of new in-orbit satellites, the landscape of GNSS is rapidly changing. In this context, SDR philosophy find a great response. Currently, the open source GNSS-SDR can acquire, track, decode and produce PVT  solutions considering GPS signals only. Differently, for the Galileo constellation, it just allows to track the first two in-orbit satellites. Hence, the aim of this project is to implement add-ons for Galileo satellite:s develop new blocks to decode Galileo navigation message, generate observables and compute PVT solutions using both Galileo E1 and GPS L1 C/A code.
