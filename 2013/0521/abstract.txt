Since WAVE communication standards have been published, there exist many relevant implementations including prototypes, products, and simulations. However the implementation varies significantly, some of them even based on old draft standards. And in some existed simulations and research papers, WiFi is used directly for V2V and V2I communication which decrease reliability of result. Besides that, ns-3 has no complete WAVE module yet.So I plan to implement WAVE 1609.4/802.11p in mac layer for ns-3.
