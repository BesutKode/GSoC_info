To keep up with the high demand of computer processing speed, concurrency will be important to the computer programming industry. Habanero Java (HJ) is a simple library that allows concurrency. Combined with Java Pathfinder (JPF), a user program can be run. JPF will then report if their program data-races, deadlocks, there are assertion violations or not. However, since HJ runtime library is fairly linear, and the concurrency scheduling is operating system dependent, it only looks at a small limited number of possible outcomes and may not find any data-races or deadlocks even if they are possible. Our project will help solve this problem, and find several possible outcomes of a precompiled HJ program with JPF. If a deadlock is possible, JPF will be able to report where the deadlock occurred.
