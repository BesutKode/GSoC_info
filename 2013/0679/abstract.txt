The Eclipse Code Recommenders project provides intelligent code completion, basing its recommendations both on the context where the completion is triggered and on the knowledge of analysed source code (stored in models). At the moment the implementation of this mechanism in Eclipse Code Recommenders is not flexible enough. One problem is that it is not possible to run the recommendation process headless outside an Eclipse environment. Furthermore the UI Integration of the preference page for the Eclipse Code Recommenders should be improved, because of the bad usability for end users which are properly not so familiar with the background of the Eclipse Code Recommenders mechanism. The intention of this GSoC Project is to redesign the models API to eliminate the described problems and to prepare for the future and for many new intelligent Eclipse Code Recommenders.
