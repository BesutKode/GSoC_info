The main goal of the present proposal is to develop a disambiguation engine for the Open-Source project Apache Stanbol using Freebase as Knowledge Base. Apache Stanbol provides a set of reusable components for Semantic Content Management. One of such component is a Content Enhancer, which can be used to extract concepts and entities from texts and link them with any Knowledge Base registered in Stanbol. This GSoC project would contribute with all developments necessary to fully support Freebase in Stanbol including disambiguation engines for this Knowledge Base.
