GNU Emacs comes with a generic version control interface called VC.  VC commands work with several different version control systems; currently, it supports GNU Arch, Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, RCS, SCCS/CSSC, and Subversion.  Version control systems provide you with three important capabilities: reversibility, concurrency, and history. However, there's a lot of work to do in VC, such as improving dealing with branches and dealing with push/pull operations. This project will add/change/clean up features that are needed for modern version control systems.
