For GSoC'13, I am interested in adding the skeletonization algorithm described in the paper ``Mean Curvature Skeletons''  into CGAL. The project is easily decoupled into two major milestones. In the first, I will focus on the implementation of the iterative contraction algorithm; in the second, I will extend it to include the functionalities needed to generate well-centered skeletons. In this document I define the goals for this project and a schedule for their completion. I also provide personal information that hopefully demonstrates that I have the necessary capabilities to bring this project to completion.
