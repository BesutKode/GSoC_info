Achieving high code coverage in testing of real-world software is challenging. High code coverage is important because code coverage gives a measure of how thoroughly the software has been tested. This proposal addresses the challenge of reaching high code coverage by proposing a novel iterative algorithm for generating unit tests in JDart. The algorithm exploits both random and systematic software testing and software verification techniques. Preliminary results show the algorithm outperforms existing techniques.
