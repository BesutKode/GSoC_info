The RTEMS Runtime Loader makes RTEMS capable of supporting applications loaded and linked at runtime.The main goal of the project is to provide more architectures support to the RTL framework, which allows sharing a single verified base image,  runtime configuration and modules loaded as needed. Then implement a new tool to convert ELF object files to a RAP format file and add new features to the RTEMS linker, such as supporting collecting all object files from archives into a RAP format archive.
