CloudSim currently uses boto to access Amazon's webservice, however boto is restricted to Amazon only, libcloud instead supports other providers. On the other hand, CloudSim wants to support private clouds via Openstack, which apart from its own API, includes a compatibility layer for AWS. Both goals may need to modify the same parts of the code, as such, a better approach is to tackle both problems in different steps.
