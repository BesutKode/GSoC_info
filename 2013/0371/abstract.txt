The project goal to investigate and design a core set of SIMD primitives
for the MLton compiler. The project would consist of three parts:
first would be a document outlining a core set of SIMD primitives for
MLton using the implementation of SIMD operations in other compilers
(e.g gcc and clang) as a reference. Second would be to implement these
primitives using x86-64(AMD 64) instructions, specifically sse
instructions. Last would be to develop an sml library to make these
primitives available to the programmer.
