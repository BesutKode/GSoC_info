As OpenNMS is an enterprise level network management tool, which relies on underlying database access for many of its functionalities. Which includes use of native sql calls using JDBC. There is a need of an object relational mapper which can remove these native sql calls with sophisticated method calls and mapping with model objects. As of now, many data access object(DAO) classes along with many annotated model objects have been created, residing in org.opennms.netmgt.dao.Hibernate and org.opennms.netmgt.model repectively, which provide a strong foundation for further porting of existing code to Hibernate. Therefore this project is mainly identifying current usage of native sql, and replacing them with proper Hibernate calls, also creating necessary DAOs wherever required.
