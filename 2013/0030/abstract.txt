One of the most important file formats that Marble regularly interacts when displaying map data is KML (Keyhole Markup Language).
However, at the time being Marble can only display and write KML files and the user is not offered  a simple graphical way of editing them.
This proposal focuses on adding this feature, keeping in mind the fact that this could provide the basis of an editing mode capable of supporting many other file formats that internally get handled as KML.
