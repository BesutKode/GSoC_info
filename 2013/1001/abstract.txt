The Legend module is an already started project in Gephi. The current module implementation already covers the basic legends models and their rendering. However, the module requires extra effort to reach a higher level of maturity before being camera-ready for release. The primary goals of this yearâ€™s project include upgrading to a better UI, revising the legend API, rewriting the legend serialization modules, making the default aspects more appealing and extending the interaction possibilities with legends. The secondary goals of this project include the introduction of two new legends and the integration of legends with the available statistical data.
