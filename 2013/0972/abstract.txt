This project will create an inbound proxy module in the OWASP Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF) so that human navigation of a website can take advantage of the functionality in OWTF plugins in an automated fashion regardless of authentication, mandatory fields, client/server side redirects or HTTP response codes that might confuse automated tools. This will ensure increased efficiency in the security testing process and also help in complete identification of the attack surface of a website by identifying and automatically analysing all application entry points as soon as the user accesses them through the proxy.
