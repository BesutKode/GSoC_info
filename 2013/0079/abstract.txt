The aim of this project is to develop StatSample. This is to eradicate conflicts with NMatrix by using SciRuby's fork of rb-gsl instead of the current gsl which uses NArray, and to make support for Ruby 1.9.3+, adding modules for Generalized Linear Models and Time Series Analysis. Also, project aims to cover the unimplemented functions of Distribution which Statsample is dependent on in Ruby, JRuby and GSL. Apart from this, the project aims to completely cover testing and proper documentation.
