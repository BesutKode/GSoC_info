Currently, SymPy has a great module for the study of mechanics in the form sympy.physics.mechanics. In this proposal, I propose the implementation of classic electric and magnetic fields for sympy.physics. This will include all their features relevant to a symbolic physics module as well their interactions with each other. Also added will be classes and functions to study the mechanics and electromagnetic properties of particle charges in the presence of such fields. My work during the summer would be based on a combination of concepts from Maxwells equations and the required laws governing vector fields and mechanics of particles. This module could serve as the foundation for further work in this direction, including future possible integration with PyDy.
