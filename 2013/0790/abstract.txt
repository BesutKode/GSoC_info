Software tools like cytoscape can represent biological data in the form of network graphs with nodes, edges, and attributes. These attributes are the static properties of the nodes and edges (components). Using them, we can easily visualize and segregate components using clustering, paths etc. However, in some fields, like cell signaling, the attributes of the nodes and edges should not be static. They change over time and with dependencies on one another. In such cases, the amount of data becomes huge and such multi-state representations, if done statically, become cumbersome and non-intuitive.
