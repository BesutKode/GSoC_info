Khipu is an advanced mathematical function plotter application which uses Analitza library of the KDE Education Project. Khipu is in playground now. The aim of this proposal is to polish necessary features of Khipu. This proposal includes improvement in the basic and necessary features which are some Application Actions, Persistence file and Plot Dictionary support as well as improving UI of Khipu. Khipu contains a lot of commented code so I will be also removing unnecessary code portions and modifying the necessary part of codebase so that Khipu can be releasable at the end of GSoC.
