Validator.nu is an online service offering validation of several widely used document schemas. One of them is HTML5, the next generation of the most important markup language of the Web. Currently, the online validator does not separate the validation logic from the Web Service code, which impedes reusing the validation service outside the online validator. The goal of this project is to refactor the Validator.nu project so that the validator be a standalone reusable Java component. This will facilitate the validation of HTML5 documents, which is an important requirement for adopters of this new generation of HTML.
