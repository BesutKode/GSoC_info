My project is aimed at extending Wikidata to make it accessible on mobile devices. Setting up Wikibase with MobileFrontend shows that while MobileFrontend can be used to achieve a mobile-friendly version of WIkidata, some problems arise due to JS based UIs not rendering properly through MobileFrontend. My plan is to implement Wikibase without Javascript to make it compatible with MobileFrontend.
