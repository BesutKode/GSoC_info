We plan to use Weave to analyze and visualize extremely large multivariate health data. Powerful computational support via statistical packages such as the R project will strengthen the analysis of large data.  This project will entail large data management, alternative architectural pipelines for server side computation and writing efficient scripts for computational algorithms. Computational results presented in intelligent visualizations will make data analysis easier and more intuitive.
