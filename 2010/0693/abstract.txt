The UPnP standard is being widely used in various types of applications, such as multimedia, smart houses, and so on. Also is being implemented by several vendors of many kinds of devices. In the current version, the KDE SC does not have the support for UPnP. This project aims at providing this support developing a Solid UPnP backend, making the system able to detect and access devices that are part of an UPnP network.
