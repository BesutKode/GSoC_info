I will develop an Eclipse Plugin which will enhance the UMC content for "Battle for Wesnoth". The plugin will have some features like: 
- Editor with autocomplete, syntax highlighting and other editing features for the WML language.
- Background checker for the written code.
- Wizards for creating the campaigns/scenarios/etc.
- Upload the created UMC content to the wesnoth website.
