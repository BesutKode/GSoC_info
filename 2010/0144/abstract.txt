SQLH: SQL Handler

This is a Hyrax plugin, useful to add SQL Query capabilities to the BES server. With the first release you can:

* Use OLFS to set constraints
* Set complex SQL (standard) query into the dataset file (Join, union)
* Set constraints into the dataset
* Set database password access (from dataset file OR using constraints)
* Set different accessed database type (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc).

It is coded in C++ using a ODBC driver (to query DBs).
