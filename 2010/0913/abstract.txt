Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) is pretty useful in plenty of applications with large-scale datasets or datasets with high dimension features. This proposal will port one of the most famous linear SVM solvers, LIBLINEAR [1] to mahout with unified interface with Pegasos [2] on mahout, which is another linear SVM solver and almost finished by myself (Mahout-232).  Two distinct contributions would be: 1) Introduce LIBLINEAR to Mahout; 2) Uniﬁed interfaces for linear SVM classiﬁer on Mahout.
