The ability to use GLSL shaders in the BGE has allowed people to do some great things. However, the api the BGE is using for the GLSL shaders is not as flexible as it should be and it does not properly reflect how GLSL shaders are run. I plan to create a more flexible api and add geometry shader support. I also plan to allow users to attach shader scripts directly to materials through the UI for more flexibility and ease of use.
