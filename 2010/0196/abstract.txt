Rearchitecting the basic Date API functionality, using the forthcoming Drupal7 version as a base, to allow for easier, cleaner, more extensible coding practices and a more robust and understandable workflow. The main areas I see for improvement from my work with Date module include object oriented, simplified and unified workflow and easy support for flexible granularity and other extensions. I would study standard implementations of date handling in other languages before proceeding.
