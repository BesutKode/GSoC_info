I propose to create a plugin which implements the last.fm API and displays/publishes information regarding it. I'd also like to make these streams easily subscribable from other sites running the same plugin or just StatusNet. I will create an interface for exporting all of the tracks you've played, for records and for moving elsewhere. Given some extra time, I'd like to create a central server to push to and the pushing functionality.
