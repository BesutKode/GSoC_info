Mailman archiving is quite rudimentary and searching is non existent. People have to rely on Google or other mail archival sites. In this project I will attempt to add search features by implementing a searching and indexing engine. I will also make a proof of concept search feature in mailman allowing users to try out the framework. More front end improvements can be made later on. Finally, a script will be made to index already existing archives.
