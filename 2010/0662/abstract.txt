Today, every website wants to be social and installs several modules on their websites to facilitate social networking for their users. I propose the module (Facebook-style Micropublisher) which will let users publish content (such as images, links, videos, pdfs, etc) along with a small text status on their (other user's) wall, like on Facebook. FBSMP will be a pluggable system whose functionality can be extended by writing small plugins.
