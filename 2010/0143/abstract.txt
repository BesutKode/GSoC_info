The goal of this project is to extend LookingGlass, GNOME Shell's debugging console, in order to provide css support. In specific, the user will be able to view and edit an element's css rules. This feature will enable managing an element's design (appearance), independently from its JavaScript functionality, and will hopefully be a user-friendly tool for designers to experiment on the look and feel of GNOME widgets.
