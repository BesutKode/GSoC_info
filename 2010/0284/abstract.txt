The past work has already shown the effectiveness of the accessibility of mobile device through wheelchair control and Bluetooth Serial Port Protocol. However, further work needs to be done for the complete design of the system.  My proposed design has three major components -- Input Processing Module, Mobile Application for Basic Functional System, and Accessibility to Mobile Device Features. The system will be designed to be extensible to any feature add-on requested in the future.
