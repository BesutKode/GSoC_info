Implement an AJAX based interface in phpMyAdmin.  Server side PHP code will be modified so that only the necessary content will be generated.  On the client side, jQuery, it's plugins and jQueryUI will be used to attach functions to events, and the response will be inserted at the appropriate location on the page.  Backward compatibility will be maintained for browsers without JavaScript support.
