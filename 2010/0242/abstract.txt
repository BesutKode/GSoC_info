The GNU Prolog for Java project made its last release on 2000-11-12. There is significant work still to do on it firstly it should compile with a modern compiler (something newer than Java 1.2), secondly it should support part 2 of the ISO standard (modules). It should also have testing extended to ensure it conforms to the ISO standard. There are various other parts of Prolog that are implemented in most compilers. A polished up version should then be released and packaged up.
