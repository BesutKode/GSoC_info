Requesting that users tag ideas with keywords would allow the efficient online calculation of sets of related submissions, opening up a variety of interesting ways to analyze data sets in terms of broader topics.  The relative importance of entire "issues" for a community and the divisiveness of a particular subject could be estimated in addition to the relative popularity of specific ideas.  These results could then be compared to the users' own perception of the community.
