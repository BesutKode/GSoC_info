Nowadays, there are several popular websites that allows one to upload and share pictures, and different people have different preference resulting in various related pictures (e.g for a given event) to be available in multiple websites. Apache PhotArk is an open source photo gallery application and currently allows you to share your pictures, and adding the ability to subscribe to external albums will permit that pictures from these different websites be aggregated into one single place.
