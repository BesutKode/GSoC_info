WordPress Achievements seeks to reward beginning developers and veterans for ways they are involved with WordPress.  WordPress Achievements will offer beginning developers a way to measure their progress.  This can be a life-saver, as the amount of information to newcomers can often seem insurmountable.  Veteran developers can have fun trying to earn more involved goals, e.g. "got huge amounts of traffic and survived".  This is a great way to keep the interest going in WordPress as a community.
