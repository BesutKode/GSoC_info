I would like to contribute a Mailbox implementation for the Apache James mail server which uses the maildir directory structure. While the current development version of James supports a variety of back-ends for storing messages, it is lacking this standard message store. Supporting maildir facilitates migration from other mail servers, integration into existing systems, and encourages using James with a message store familiar to many administrators.
