The trace server contains a database and two front ends, one for storing and one for querying data. During the execution of the SUT by JPF, a trace emitter captures events from JPF listener, add them some property values, and stores then using the trace storer interface. On the analysis side, a trace analyzer queries the database by using the trace query interface, generating a number of reports as a result. Report generation will allow events generated by extensions to be included in the trace.
