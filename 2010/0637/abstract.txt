Krita is a raster graphics editing application whose aim is to offer an integrated solution to create images from scratch. The goal of this project is to improve Krita's simulation of real media, through new special brush engines and filters that simulate the real life tools manga artists use to paint with patterns, and implementation of impasto effects simulating the use of thick paint or sculpting media on the canvas, of interest to fine artists who want to explore digital media.
