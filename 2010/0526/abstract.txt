Escher is an implementation of the client side of the X11 protocol written completely in Java and is the library behind XPeer code in GNU Classpath. XPeer is an implementation of the AWT Toolkit based on Escher. The proposal objectives are to revive the project and sync with GNU Classpath, fix and refactor some parts of the API, and lastly start decoupling X11 specific code from the rest of the API, to allow other backends like the proper Java X11 code, OpenGL or DirectFB.
