I am a first-year graduate student in Information Systems (a joint business and computer science program) at New York University.  I have many years of non-technical work experience, but I'm just starting out as a programmer and would love to get involved in the open-source and Systers communities.  I propose working on bug fixes and wishlist items for existing features as they seem best suited to my experience and a great way to learn the Systers code, Mailman and Python.
