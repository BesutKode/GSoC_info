JikesRVM a Java virtual machine written in Java uses the Memory Management Toolkit (MMTk) to provide a wide variety of garbage collectors.  Currently MMTk only provides support for Stop The World (STW) garbage collection.  This project will implement an existing concurrent copying GC algorithm in MMTk and JikesRVM as a proof of concept and to provide future GC researchers with a basis for comparisons.
