wxWidgets currently has very few tests for its GUI classes. This proposal aims to remedy this by first providing an improved GUI testing system and set of documentation followed by a large set of new tests. In turn this should help reduce the number of bugs in the project itself and improve consistency whilst making it easier for new developers to add their own tests in the future.
