The OMAP3530 DSP core is quite powerful but not easy to prototype algorithms on, since there is no standard I/O functionality available directly. The project will allow developers to use familiar POSIX functionality such as terminal output/input and file access and compile their code with ease, enabling them to focus on building and optimizing their DSP algorithm instead of dealing with the details of interprocessor communications.
