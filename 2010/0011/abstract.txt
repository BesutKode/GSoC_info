This project intends to enable Drupal importing data from various existing WebAPIs (e.g. Twitter, Facebook, XML, RDF, etc) and further save it into Drupal's objects (e.g. nodes, users, database, etc)

This is achieved by utilizing and integrating both Views and Feeds module in Drupal.

The process of importing external data from WebAPIs will be:
external WebAPIs -> Views -> Feeds -> Drupal (nodes, users, comments, database, etc)
