One of the priorities in Underwater Networking research, is to have a complete simulation framework. The NS-3 UAN module is a first step in this direction. This project aims to integrate the efforts of UAN module, extending it to make a simulation framework that researchers will be able to use for their aims. The extension will consists of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) simulator (navigation and movement) and some energy related classes.
