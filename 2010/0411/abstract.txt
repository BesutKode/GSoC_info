The Snakes on a Tor (SoaT) exit scanner has the potential to dramatically improve the safety of Tor users by ferreting out misconfigured and malicious exit nodes.  At present it suffers from certain stability issues which prevent it from being run for long periods of time, and from an overabundance of false positives in the results it generates. I will work on improving the stability of SoaT and reducing the number of false positives which it reports.
