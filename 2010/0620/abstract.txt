The proposed project is to implement support for multiple repositories in sys-apps/portage. Today, portage handle just one repository of ebuilds, with a lot overlays atached to it. The idea is to change Portage internals to support a stack of ebuilds' repositories. Each repository will be a standalone repository and may have overlays applyed to it. Syncing the repositories and overlays will be done using emerge and repositories will be added in a config file.
