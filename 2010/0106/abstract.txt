Adding an external mixer mode to Mixxx will greatly improve Mixxx's ability to act as a part of a digital vinyl system. Mixxx's current method of achieving this involves diverting one deck to the main output, and the other to the headphone output, allowing the two to be mixed externally. However, no features, such as the equalizer, can be disabled. Benefits of disabling various features include increased CPU time for other threads, and UI recognition of unwanted features.
