Current ASCEND compiler, coded using Flex/Bison is highly effective, but has a huge and difficult code that is hard to understand, maintain and extend. Using more modern language description and parser generation tool like ANTLR can result in a modular, maintainable and fast compiler. Additionally, some of the objectives of next-generation ASCEND syntax can be incorporated in the solution.
