In order to acquire better result at systems administration, the automatization of their monitoring and configuration is essential. Puppet covers some of these needs but lacks types for virtual machines administration. Due this fact, I intend to implement those types. Another feature to implement in this GSoC, is getting Gepetto included at Puppet's core to provide an environment to build and test the Puppet configuration would be a great improvement.
