The idea is to make an ORM to make it dead easy to store, retrieve and update objects from Tracker. Tracker store now being a GNOME module, it's gonna be used by more and more applications. It's therefore very important to ensure it's easy to use. Currently, it can quickly become tedious to update triples in an RDF database. I intend to give a stab at that problem, and hopefully succeed :)
