Artists create with their hands. As more work moved to computers, hardware vendors responded by offering sensitive input devices such as graphics tablets and 3D mice. Blender has basic pen support, but more often treats the pen as a glorified mouse. Many tasks beyond paint/sculpt would benefit from an artistic touch. This project strengthens the connection between an artistâ€™s hands and their work by enabling Blender to take better advantage of input devices beyond the mouse and keyboard.
