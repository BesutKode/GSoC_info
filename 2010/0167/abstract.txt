Ventoo is a visual configuration editor that lets the user graphically edit system configuration files. Ventoo was originally written by Luis F. Araujo in '07, but was never finished, as it is a large project. All the existing code is in python and GTK. This summer I'd like to work on Ventoo until it is useable and can be put into portage. I have several ideas that I will outline below that I think would make Ventoo useable by the average gentoo user.
