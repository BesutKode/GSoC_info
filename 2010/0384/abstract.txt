A Graphical User Interface in which users can simply backup and restore KDE applications' configuration files. This will help users who accidentally lose or corrupt their configuration files which cause several native KDE technologies and applications to fail like a disappearing panel or loss of accounts informations in KMail/Kopete, etc. Also, this user interface will show which setting(s) of the KDE applications change which options when, like a source control system.
