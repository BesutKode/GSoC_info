This is a follow-up project to last year's successful SCORM project, which focused on input/export and presentation of SCORM packages. During the last project, it turned out that implementing the runtime environment (RTE) is a relatively big task. Thus, currently, the RTE implements only the most basic RTE-API functions and is therefore only capable of importing simple packages. A standard conformant RTE is still a precondition for using the outcome of the former project in real-world scenarios.
