Mobility is a major issue nowadays, and android is a great platform to bring sakai 3 to mobile. Android is an open source operating system for mobile device which has the support of Google, and every day the is more mobile phones and more students using it.

This is just an idea, but I think that would be nice to be able to sync all our events from sakai (like: new assignments, new tests, dead lines...) alert us and let check them.
