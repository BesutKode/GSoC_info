This is a project of development of Thousand Parsec python-wxWidgets client. The main focus of it is improving GUI and, consequently, internals. The current visual appearance of this client can be named "in very active development" -- it's full of information, more suitable for programmer than a gamer, it's not customizable, etc. I'm going to make it more usable and add several new features (like tech browser).
