This project will contribute to the development of DXMPP (http://drupal.org/project/dxmpp) module and add additional functionalities to it. The very first goal will be to add Multi User Chat capability (MUC). The next step will be to provide alternate theme(s). Provision for alternate registration and authentication schemes. API cleanup, extension and documentation will go on side by side. Also support for other modules such as token and views will be provided.
