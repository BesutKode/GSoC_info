Telepathy Tubes could have a large number of application in KDE but an usable interface to easily access to Telepathy using Nepomuk resources is required. This project will provide a bridge for Telepathy Tubes and for file transfer within KDE and then will use it in two different applications: "Plasma widgets sharing with contacts using StreamTubes" and "Collaboration in mathematical software using Cantor and Telepathy DBusTubes."
