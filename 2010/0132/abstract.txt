When you first set up a WordPress site, there are certain steps you have to go through: pick a theme, change your password, edit your tagline, choose your comment settings, etc. On the Dashboard screen there will be a module that kept track of how many of these things you’ve done, and marked off your progress. Each successive login would offer the user an option to finish/enhance their site setup by completing another thing(s) they haven’t gotten around to yet.
