Users and developers should be able to build and use Chromium OS in as many ways as possible. They should be able to run it in their favorite virtualization platform, boot it with PXE, or boot it as a thin client. The process to do these things should be as easy as possible. This project proposes to add improved virtualization support, make the process of booting over PXE easy, and explore the various technologies that would allow Chromium OS to work in one or more thin client environments.
