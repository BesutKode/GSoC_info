Open Smalltalk implementations don't have a decent profiling tool, and none of them have any user interface...

My goal in the project is to develop that interface, to make it intuitive, easy to use, fast and dynamic.

I have experience in making user interfaces with Smalltalk, and I'm confident that I have the necessary skills to complete the project in time without sacrificing the quality of the code.
