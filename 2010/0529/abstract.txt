Biologists infer evolutionary, structural, and functional relationships between biopolymers from similarities and divergences of primary structure in multiple sequence alignments.  I plan to code a module for BioJava which manages an alignment and offers several implementation options.  Addition of this framework to BioJava would assist Java-based bioinformatics tools as a reference version of current techniques and as a foundation on which to research variations of multiple sequence alignment.
