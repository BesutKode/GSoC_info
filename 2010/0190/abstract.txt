The project implies implementing within the PaGMO project code base, the functionality for multi processor computing using MPI, IPython and BOINIC. The task requires designing a clustering strategy and the creation of special base classes for each parallelizing approach (MPI, BOINC). The solution needs to work irrespective of the migration policy. I plan to create a parallel_island class that inherits from the base island class and implements the marshalling and unmarshalling of the MPI objects.
