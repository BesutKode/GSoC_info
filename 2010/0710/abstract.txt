Content is an important part of the Freenet experience. Good, plentiful content attracts users, which attracts donations and creates more nodes, both of which, directly or indirectly, improve performance and security of the network. As such, to make Freenet better, we must make the process of getting information from the network to the user quick, easy, and safe. I am proposing changes to the ContentFilter and adjacent systems so as to realize this.
