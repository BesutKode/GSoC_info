The aim of this project is to provide a common testing framework for Pardus to run all types of tests â€“ hardware, unit or desktop and then being able to send the results back to the testing team. Under this project I would be developing a framework that would allow the creation, interpretation and execution of XML-based test-case files. This framework would be invaluable for the testing team, developers as well as Pardus users and the reports generated could be analyzed to fix bugs effectively
