Marble currently supports GPS devices and can download maps from the internet using OpenStreetMap.The proposal aims at making the Navigation Mode of Marble user friendly and implementing algorithms for smooth re-centering and Zooming,showing route instructions to the users, making offline routing convenient,improving the interface for small screen devices and introduce flexibility for the users. The result would be a big leap towards turning Marble into a sophisticated navigation device.
