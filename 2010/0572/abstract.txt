This project aims to create a version of the System Tray currently used in Plasma Desktop and Plasma Netbook, redesigned so that it works sensibly on the small screen size of a mobile device. The redesigned System Tray should retain the present functionalities of standard one - supporting application/applet icons, tray plasmoids, as well as notifications. It should also be developed in sync with the infant Plasma Mobile shell so that it integrates in that environment as seamlessly as possible.
