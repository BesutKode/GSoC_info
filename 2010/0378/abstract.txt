This proposal aims to offer at least an experimental implementation of both, in a way that offers user a subset of available ports (from the ports tree) in an ABI-stable way which will also be maintained for at least the period of 12 months from the SoC project start, together with their binary packages and a rsync-like distribution method for both. The proposed technologies for building this infrastructure include reliance on existing FreeBSD tools and libraries, with Lua as the glue language.
