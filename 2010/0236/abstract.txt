I want to contribute to the ongoing development of "modern" language features support (standard Fortran 2003 and up-coming standard Fortran 2008) of the GNU Fortran compiler.

My plans are to work on some "small" items like ASSOCIATE construct and extending the already founded OOP support, and especially help with the implementation of Co-Arrays (in particular, work on design and implementation of a "real" parallel one in addition to the currently developed "single-image" only support).
