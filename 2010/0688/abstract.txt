In the aftermath of a disaster or crisis, surveys are necessary to collect information in order to assess and plan recovery activities. Surveys also serve as a tool to assess the needs and vulnerability of the people whom are vulnerable; they also serve as a means to help better respond to disaster and crises. My task for this summer will be to implement a tool allow surveys to be created, entered, and saved.
