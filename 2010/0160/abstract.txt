The goal is be to develop a web application that runs on mobile devices and acts as a client for an XMMS2 daemon. The application will be a remote the user can use to control playback, manage playlists and query the media library. A web client is a good approach because with the new HTML5/CSS features it's now possible to create great user experiences using only portable web technologies. 
The two deliverables for this project are the python xmms2 client and the mobile web application.
