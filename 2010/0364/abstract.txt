We say Linux is free to use and enjoy. Unfortunately, quite often this freedom is conditional on the quality of your Internet connection, and if you cannot afford broadband at your area, installation of the software packages becomes a stumbling block. This project is not about building new fast networks all over the world, but rather about making the installation software more intelligent and optimized to use the existing infrastructure and bring open source software closer to an end user.
