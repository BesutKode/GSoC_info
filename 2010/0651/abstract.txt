Formulating the computational core of an image-stitching implementation can function on the Android Phone platform is challenging but within reach. A key difference between registration of images on the phone and 'offline' registration is that the phone contains accelerometers that can aid in the registration. I propose to implement a stitching routine that combines Kalman Filtering using the accelerometer sensors as predictors, and feature detection & multi-scale optical flow as measurements.
