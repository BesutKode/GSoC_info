The goal of this project is to implement a plugin that will facilitate the discovery of Gene Expression data from open repositories such as GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) and ArrayExpress. We will use the Entrez and EBI web services as the backend support for this plugin. Users can use this tool to find the targeted experiment data, download them locally, and perform certain data cleaning and preprocessing. The final results (fold, p-values) will be add as attributes to nodes in Cytoscape.
