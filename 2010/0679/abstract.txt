Testing the feasibility of building a dynamic language as an AOT (ahead-of-time) compiled language, and as a research project into optimizing dynamic language's in this manor. This project should also establish and maintain a running documentation of building a front-end in GCC with interfaces and Intermediate Representations GENERIC/GIMPLE documented in the GCC internals manual with possibly a working skeleton front-end similar to the old Tree-Lang.
