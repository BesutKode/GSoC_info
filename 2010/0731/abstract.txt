I have solid background in computer science and engineering, and would like to contribute to an open source project. I am specifically interested in CITP projects especially FedThread for two reasons. First, it is related to government transparency issue which plays an important role in modern life; second, I am familiar with some search techniques so that I believe I can come up with my ideas and have my own contribution once I have chance to involve in.
