The idea is to develop a GUI tool to manage Apertium Monolingual and Bilingual XML files with the follow objectives:
• Create a alternative form to edit dix files with GUI resources. 
• Develop, initially, monolingual dictionaries but keeping the particular format of each file.
• Minimize the direct manipulation of XML files, providing features that reduce this need.  
• Making use of DixTools to keep code reuse.
