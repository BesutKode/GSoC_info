Tk Widget Styling Support is a really old topic. First mention I found is http://www.tcl.tk/cgi-bin/tct/tip/48 with date of 23 July 2001, and I want to finish it now. I often have that urge to change the look of applications. But I know that theming is not just to make eye candys. This topic is generally about rewriting the code from Motif-looking widgets to use Qt or GTK instead. That way system layouts can have an effect on Tk programs.
