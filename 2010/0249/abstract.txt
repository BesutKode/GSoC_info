QueryPath, being a XML/HTML parser that lies between DOM and SAX, is an essential part of the Drupal and PHP communities. By updating QueryPath, the QueryPath Drupal module, the example Drupal modules, and the Database API, while also converting QueryPath from a top-down architecture to a bottom-up, I will help QueryPath keep and increase its popularity and help Drupal become more of a go-to CMS for websites that want to focus on web services.
