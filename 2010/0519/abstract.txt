AbiWord is a free and open-source word processing program runs on various platforms while available with different languages as well.
AbiWord now provides features like paragraph borders and shading, some new set of features for tables and text boxes. But AbiWord has not a proper mechanism to set these properties yet. The goal of this project is to implement a GUI dialog based mechanism to expose these features.
