This project will focus primarily on getting BD-J (Blu-ray Disc Java) support into libbluray. BD-J support is important because many of the advanced features and extra content in Blu-ray movies uses BD-J. Currently people with Blu-ray drives are tied to Windows if they want to access this content, they are forced to use proprietary Blu-ray software which does not run on Linux or various other operating systems. This project will also integrate the BD-J support into VLC.
