Improve thousand parsec's KDE4 client Parsek to the point that it is possible to play a game with it.
The improvement includes a user friendlier user interface which looks more like a game client than a chat client.
Add missing client parts like star-map, proper account-manager, settings, chat.
Also integrate the client more into KDE4.
