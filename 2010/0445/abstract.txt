AppleDouble files, commonly used to store metadata and extended attributes in filesystems without native support for them, would be supported by all POSIX-compliant OpenAFS platforms.  This would provide a means to allow client-side extended attribute support to be added in a backward-compatible manner without requiring changes to the AFS file servers.  It also opens the door for future protocol changes to be made, if better accommodation of metadata and extended attributes is desired.
