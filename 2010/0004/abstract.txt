The global cache acts as a giant patch pool where Darcs first looks for a patch when
grabbing new patches. This saves time by not downloading the same patch twice from a
remote server. It also saves space by storing the patch only once, if you ensure your
cache and your repositories are on the same hardlink-supporting filesystem. Although,
being the global cache on the biggest performance enhancing tools, there are issues
which affect it in certain circumstances negatively.
