Click is a software architecture for building configurable routers. By using different combinations of packet processing units called elements, a Click router can be made to perform a specific kind of functionality. This flexibility provides a good platform for testing and experimenting with different protocols. This project aims to integrate ns-3 with the Click Modular Router so as to enable rapid protocol development.
