I am a master student in National University of Singapore in computer sciences. I have experiences in many computing projects before in both studying and research. I am interested in working with Berkman Center in developing software for its MediaCloud and WebCrawl projects. For the MediaCloud, I intend to work on Multi-language support for MediaCloud, extract body text and allow rich queries.
