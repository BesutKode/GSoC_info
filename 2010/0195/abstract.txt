In this project, I will complete the requirements of Dr. Saunier's project: Feature-based Tracker. For the short term goal, I will use the provided KLT tracker in OpenCV to implement Saunier and Sayed's "A feature-based tracking algorithm for vehicles in intersections". This tasks involves creating an interface for feature extraction, matching and tracking in OpenCV. For the medium term goal, I will use the developed interface to implement two more feature-based tracking methods.
