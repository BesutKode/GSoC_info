Dionaea,as the successor for Nepenthes low interaction honeypot,has been developed since year 2009.It served as the malware collector by emulation of protocol and services.It is widely used and better performance and functionality.Yet it may have more features to adapt the fast changing malware landscape.I would like to improve Dionaea features and enhance its support functions,in term of new DCE-RPC calls,XMPP features polishing,NTLMv2 authentication and SMB stack test suite with Scapytain.
