Galaxy is a popular web based interface for integrating biological tools and analysis pipelines. HyPhy provides a popular package for molecular evolution and sequence statistical analysis. Integrating those tools will make Galaxy even more powerful and useful. Hence probably increase its popularity.

The goal of this project is to integrate the relevant tools into Galaxy. Functional tests will be developed for tools and workflows, along with high level documentation for end users.
