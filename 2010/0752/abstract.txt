The overall goal of this project is to extend many of the useful features Jalview has for protein sequence alignments to support RNA sequence analysis. By adding more parsing and analysis of the information in Stockholm files, I can add support for RNA secondary structure alignment annotation, such as coloring schemes. Other features, such as an embedded RNA secondary structure viewer and the ability to import existing RNA sequences and alignments from the Rfam database will also be added.
