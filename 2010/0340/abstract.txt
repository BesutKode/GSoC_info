I propose a (self-)hosted, secure, usable and scalable web application that allows users to create and run nmap scans. The proposed design separates the web application that provides user-specific functionality from the daemon that queues up and runs nmap scans; by using this kind of tiering the aim is to both reduce security risks and allow for easy scaling. Must-have features include the ability to create and save scans, view and download the results, and compare the output of different scans.
