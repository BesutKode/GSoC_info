This supports the learning website Software Carpentry by creating an extension to IDLE for learning and teaching Python. This extension will allow IDLE to step through pre-written source code, presenting it to the user, stopping to pop up explanations, ask questions and wait for answers, mimicking the  interaction between a teacher and student. This will make the development and distribution of tutorials easier by allowing students to engage with the tutorial, rather than just reading.
