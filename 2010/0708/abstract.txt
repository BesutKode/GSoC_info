Bringing SyncML support to Akonadi via a akonadi patches for Syncevolution. Syncevolution is considered one of the most mature PIM synchronization solution on the linux platform. However, It  doesnt support Kde4/Akonadi yet. But, it is extensible and currently work is going on to bring Akonadi support to syncevolution. I wish to study it thoroughly and complete it as much as i can this (G)SoC.
