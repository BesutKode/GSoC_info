Last year, I have took the project, and as a student of GSoC2009. I have finished partly a task, as Linus and some of the Linux community against implement pioctl() directly  in the kernel. We used other ways to talk to the kernel after we gave up some implementation that have done. There is my project idea and time line at last. My major is distributed file system. As I have some experience of my research and this project, I think I could do it well.
