Extend the symbolic execution to allow efficient string analysis of all Java string operations.  The implementation should support both automata-based decision procedures for strings as well as bit-vector based approaches. For the former the Java String Analyzer (JSA) system can be used and for the latter HAMPI. The project should include a detailed comparison of these two approaches.
