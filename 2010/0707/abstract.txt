Implementing a speciation vs. duplication inference algorithm as an extension to BioRuby would make use of existing code infrastructure and also make the tool readily available to a community of phylogenetics researchers.

Project Goals:

1) Implement Zmasek and Eddy's speciation/duplication inference algorithm for binary trees as an extension to BioRuby.
2) Extend the above speciation/duplication inference algorithm to support non-binary species trees as in Vernot et al.
