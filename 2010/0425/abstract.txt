Statsmodels is a Python package for statistical and econometric modelling that I successfully initiated as my 2009 GSoC project.  The main goals for this summer are to port statsmodels to Python 3, focus on design issues that are necessary for a mature library, and to extend the types of estimators available. The result will be a maintainable and easily extensible Python 3 package that supports most common statistical and econometric modelling in a user-friendly environment.
