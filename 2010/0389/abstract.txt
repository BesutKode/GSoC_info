Being a compiled language with a strong static type system, Haskell stands a
good chance of surpassing traditional languages used for web applications
(php, Python, Ruby) in terms of speed, correctness, and developer productivity.
My proposal is to write a high performance HTML generation library using the
Data.Text library, focusing on correctness, efficiency, composability and ease
of use.
