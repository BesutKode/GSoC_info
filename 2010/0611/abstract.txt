The existing Systers code is a branch rather than in patch form, making it hard to test on various Operating systems like Debian, Fedora, and even between two releases of Ubuntu8.04 and Ubuntu9.10 it will be harder to test and debug. This proposal aims to introduce automation into the development cycle so that new releases are compatible with upstream development cycles. The BZR Launchpad CVS has a very nice system of PPA which can be utilized for release control and documentation too.
