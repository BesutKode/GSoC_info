The project I wish to develop is a native iPhone application for ATutor Social. The iPhone application will make use of the RESTful web service, allow the user to sign in via OAuth authentication and access 4 different types of information: network activity, contacts, OpenSocial gadgets and network groups. To further benefit the user, the iPhone application will also support push notification and accessibility features like VoiceOver.
