Message Access Profile permits the sending/receiving of SMS over Bluetooth. A device first initiates a session with a phone. Then, the device can interact with the phone through two services, both implemented as OBEX services. The phone runs a Message Access Service (MAS) server, which presents a virtual hierarchy to the other device. The other device is not only acting as a MAS client but as a Message Notification Service (MNS) server, which listens for incoming notifications of new messages.
