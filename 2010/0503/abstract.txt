This project has the goal to develop a framework to provide support for dynamically extending the NetBSD kernel using the Lua programming language. I intend to allow adaptation of the kernel and its subsystems for different purposes at runtime, through download of Lua scripts and exposure of kernel internals to Lua. Moreover, this framework will provide support for rapid prototyping and experimentation with new algorithms and mechanisms inside the kernel.
