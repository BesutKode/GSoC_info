Chilling Effects currently has a MySQL database of approximately 30,000 cease and desist notices. The main objective of my project is to create a web-based framework for asking research questions about the data, including Who sends and receives them frequently? What kind of content is targeted most often? What happens to URLs mentioned in the letters? This framework will be written with HTML, CSS, PHP, and Perl.
