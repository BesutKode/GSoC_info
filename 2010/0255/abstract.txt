This project aims to improve Crystal Space's LOD support, which is currently a manual process with replication of mesh information. A tool will be developed which will preprocess meshes and compute their LODs. On the runtime side, the engine will be adapted to render this new mesh format. An adaptive LOD scheme will be developed, which will select an LOD level based on frame rate.
