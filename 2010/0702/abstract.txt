The high level difference between a web app and a native app is pretty simple. A web app does its computation in the server where a native app does it in the client machine. A web app uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript for rendering user interface and interacting with user where a native app uses client machines windowing API. The Native Client project targets to pull these two breeds closer and Pencil is a specimen application to show how it can be done.
