The OpenOffice plug-in for Creative Commons was completed in 2007 as a GSoC project. But now it is out dated and the current extension cannot be used properly in OpenOffice 3 versions. So I plan to: 
(1) update the Creative Commons plug-in for OO.o 3 SDK. 
(2) Add support for CC0. 
(3) Improve the UI and add support for OO.o Draw.
