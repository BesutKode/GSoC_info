Hybrid automaton is a standard model for hybrid systems. Currently, Scilab/Xcos has a support for modeling of hybrid automata, but it does not allow direct specification of automata and require manual transformation of automaton's graph into syntax of Xcos diagrams.
This project is intended to provide a convenient environment for direct modeling of hybrid automata in Scilab/Xcos.
