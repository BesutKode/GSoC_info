This project aims to port GRAPHITE's CLooG interface to the official CLooG. GRAPHITE 
uses CLooG to perform code generation for loops represented in the polyhedral model. 
By porting the interface, GRAPHITE is able to use new backends for generating code 
out of polyhedral program representations, the Integer Set Library (ISL) and a new 
backend for the Parma Polyhedral Library (PPL).
