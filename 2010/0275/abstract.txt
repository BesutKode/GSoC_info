Robot View is an "app" for the Android that allows one to intuitively capture spherical panoramas. It utilises the platform's inertial and magnetic sensors, GPS, OpenGL, OpenCV and Camera. Sensor data is used to estimate camera pose similar to Street View. An Android port of OpenCV's feature detection and 3D reconstruction functions combined with the estimated pose can be used to seamlessly stitch panoramas on the device. The end goal: crowd-sourced Street View creation from any Android device.
