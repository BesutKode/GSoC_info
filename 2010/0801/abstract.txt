This project aims at developing an API providing services for log file anonymization through a C library. Indeed, sharing logs is one of the main ideas of Honeynet Project, but this could involve leakage of sensitive data that their owners would not want to expose to the public for security reasons. In order to reach this goal, this API must be able to find out sensitive data from several types of logs and hide them while preserving the meaning of logs.
