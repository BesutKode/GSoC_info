Kernel mode-setting allows for faster and more graphical boots with fewer flickers. Only the big three drivers, Radeon, Intel, and Nouveau, support KMS, but there are many more X11 drivers that could benefit as well. Unfortunately, the big three drivers are large and complex, and is there no official documentation for writing KMS drivers. This project aims to provide both documentation for writing KMS drivers and a basic, unaccelerated, reference KMS driver for Permedia3-series hardware.
