This project is the development a new tool for doing morphological analysis and generation, integrated well into the Apertium pipeline, and based on the Helsinki Finite State Toolkit (HFST). It will function as an alternate for Apertium's lt-proc tool. This will provide Apertium with the ability to handle languages whose morphology is too complicated for lttoolbox to deal with, reducing the barrier to creating new language pairs for languages with freely available HFST-compatible data.
