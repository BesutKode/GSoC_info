The end result of this project would be to have KDE's flagship PIM application Kontact use KDE's Plasma libraries to draw its summary page. This will involve crafting custom plasma applets that access the functionality of various KDE applications using the Akonadi PIM layer, and the end result should provide a containment that will have all of these applets available, and also have the option of placing these widgets on the desktop.
