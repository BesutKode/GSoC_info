Biopython is a widely used Bioinformatics library. It provides the structural biologist with the Bio.PDB module which provides several useful functions. However, there are several simple biologically relevant questions that Bio.PDB still cannot answer. This project aims to extend Bio.PDB with methods (e.g. S-S bridge probing, Polar Hydrogen Addition) that will make it even more attractive for the biological community.
