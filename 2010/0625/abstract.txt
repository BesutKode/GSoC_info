I propose to develop a social media monitoring system as a web application for primary investigators or  others (the user) to use to analyze the social impact of outreach activities. Each user will have a password-protected account that can be accessed through a web browser to view accumulated data which is analyzed in real-time. The user will be presented with a variety of tools they can use to visualize, filter, order, and export the returned data.
