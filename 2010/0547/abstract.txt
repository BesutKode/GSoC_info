Hackage has grown to have thousands of uploads and millions of downloads. I plan on making hackage-server, the candidate replacement for the current hackage-scripts, deployable so we can crowd-source the process of picking the best packages for a job. I'll add statistics, reverse dependencies, and build reports, and also develop an infrastructure to support things like voting, tags, package reviews, and other content that can be contributed.
