This project aims to extend the current set of RTEMS block device interface capabilities while increasing its compatibility with different devices and its efficiency. This is achievable by providing RTEMS with a standardized and efficient block device driver that supports the ATAPI and SATA standards. This project shall provide RTEMS with a working and partially tested driver at the end of the Google Summer Of Code.
