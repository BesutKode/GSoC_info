The goal of this project is to improve the file handling capabilities of WordPress by making PHP's stream wrapper functionality a part of the File API. PHP stream wrappers allow virtually any type of resource to be represented as a normal file. Stream wrappers will make the implementation details of file management transparent to developers fostering cross plugin interoperability and increasing the flexibility of WordPress.
