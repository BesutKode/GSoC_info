Kernel mode-setting (KMS) and supporting Graphics Kernel Memory Manager Support (GEM) exist in Linux and need to be ported to the BSDs for the next generation of graphics drivers.  Complete porting would enable BSD users and developers to fully participate in developing the next generation of drivers. This is a critical time for the BSDs to catch up, but an opportune one as documentation and drivers have matured for relatively recent graphics cards.
