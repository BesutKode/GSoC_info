The goal will be to add support for generic multi-touch devices, and to provide a general gesture recognition framework. Multi-touch support will subscribe to OS level touch events, process the data into standardized SDL touch events, and pass the events to the application. Gesture support will be added as a seperate layer between all input devices and the user. This will give support for mouse gestures and combination mouse/keyboard/multi-touch gestures as well as standard multitouch gestures.
