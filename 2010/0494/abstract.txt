The inclusion of RDF in Drupal 7 makes Drupal the best mainstream tool for publishing Semantic Web content. However, for people to understand SemWeb, we need to help them use the data produced by Drupal 7 sites. Tools like MS Pivot provide sleek visualizations of data. In this project, I aim to make this kind of data viz open source and easy. With sleek views of linked data, Drupal will not only be the best way to produce SemWeb content, but also the best way to make something of that content.
