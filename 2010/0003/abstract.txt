ZooKeeper servers detect the failure of other servers and clients by counting the number of 'ticks' for which it doesn't get a heartbeat from other machines. This is the 'timeout' method and it works very well; however it is possible that it is too aggressive and not easily tuned for some more unusual ZooKeeper installations. This project's goals are to abstract the failure detector to a separate module, to implement several failure detectors and to compare their appropriateness for ZooKeeper.
