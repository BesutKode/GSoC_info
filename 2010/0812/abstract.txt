The Neo FreeRunner (FR) is the first open-source smartphone, with all sources provided, including the schematics (but not the GSM part).
Today, several distributions can run on it, and Debian is one of them.
However, the current way of installing Debian to the FR is to run a shell script from a Linux distribution already running on the phone.
I propose to write Debian Installer support for the FR.
