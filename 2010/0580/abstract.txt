Handling binary data is a very tricky task and is very easy to do mistakes when hard-coding this type of algorithm. Making a library wich helps in manipulating of binary data would be very helpful because it could be used in a widely types of applications sice neither C++ nor Boost have utilities for performing bitwise logical operations on bitstrings. This application proposes a comprehensive set of these algorithms and data structures and intend to be useful, portable and efficient.
