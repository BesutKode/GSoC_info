It is hard to get started to work on a new community, even just to work on a new project. I would like people to be eager to contribute to new projects. During this summer I would like to ease that process by improving KDevelop in the 3 steps that I think that are the most important to get started. The project retrieval, the startup information gathering and the deliver of the code.
