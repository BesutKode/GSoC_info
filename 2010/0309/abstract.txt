On this project I look forward to implement the Reverse Geocoding System (with backends from Google Maps, geonames.org and Open Street Maps), expand the WorldMapWidget2 (to make it return the number of images and a URL of one image from each tile) and the  Advanced Search tool (by making it able to filter images by location) and add a new selection display model (where the user will have the possibility to visualize his filtered images directly on a bigger map).
