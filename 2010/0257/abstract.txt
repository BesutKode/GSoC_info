Create an algorithm to detect token renaming on diffs and add an interface option for collapsing rename changes, simplifying the review process. Add branch tracking in a review providing a way to pull newer changes in the branch from the repository into the review via the web UI; detect if the changes were already merged into the trunk and allowing the review of a patch as a whole or as a series of individual commits, making Review Board better fit a modern post-commit review workflow.
