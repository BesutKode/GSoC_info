Rework and extend the import/export functionality of Semantic MediaWiki (SMW) to allow also full, general RDF import.

One motivation and use case is to use SMW as a collaborative RDF editor integrated with workflow / workbench software like Bioclipse, for workflows of the type:

Import RDF --> Collaboratively edit --> Export in same format

The project will include general reworkings of the import/export functionality though, which that specific use case can take advantage of.
