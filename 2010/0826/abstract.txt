Simple and lightweight Atom HTML-based browser, that will be used for browsing the CXF logs. This browser will support feed paging - will let users see the contents of the current page plus it will provide an option to follow the links: next, previous, first and last page. Implementation will be based on the existing CXF JAX-RS WebClient API. All code will be added to the 'rt/management-web' module.
