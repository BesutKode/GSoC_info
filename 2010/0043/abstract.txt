Goal of this project is to port drawterm to the iPhone. Drawterm is a mean of making a cpu connection to a Plan 9 machine without running a Plan 9 terminal. With the possibility to mount client devices into the host system enables interesting interaction with the iPhone platform. Thus, this port should also encourage future experimentation with the mobile usage of Plan9. Another interesting aspect is, how the mouse and keyboard driven interface of rio translates into a touchscreen based device.
