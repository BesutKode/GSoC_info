Mifos is committed to ensuring high software quality even through rapid development iterations. Automated acceptance tests contribute to this goal by making sure there are no regressions as changes are made to the code base by driving the web user interface and validating the effects. This project seeks to further this goal by extending the coverage of the tests and making improvements to the testing infrastructure.
