Virtual World is fast become the norm for collaboration and Cobalt is the smalltalk implementation of it. It is also open source and uses peer to peer. Since 3D content is very important in virtual worlds, a native 3D CAD inside Cobalt will be very useful. FreeCAD/Cobalt aims to have a solid modeling kernel for true solid representation, NURBS for complex surfacing and a multibody dynamics engine for motion simulation.
