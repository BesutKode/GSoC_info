Implementing the ExplorerBrowser control in wine. The IExplorerBrowser interface and its implementation available in Windows since Windows Vista allows developers to host an instance of the Explorer in their applications. Implementing this in wine would have several benefits such as simplifying the later development of new file dialogs and the Explorer, and provide support for properly running windows applications using this interface to host the Explorer.
