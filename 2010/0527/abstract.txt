The objective of this project is to implement the Immix garbage collection algorithm onto GHC, the Glasgow Haskell Compiler. I believe that Immix is the current state-of-the-art garbage collector described in the literature, and that GHC would greatly benefit from this more modern algorithm. The immediate benefit would be a boost on the performance of native code produced by GHC, as Immix has been shown to deliver gains of 5-to-27% when compared to more traditional garbage collection algorithms.
