The goal of this project is to develop a RESTful service which orchestrates third party transfers and handles credential delegation using OAuth. This will provide support for credential delegation in a manner that is easy via web and web services using OAuth.. The service will be developed in an extensible manner which will allow to use any transfer service, and will provide a concrete example with GridFTP as the transfer service.
