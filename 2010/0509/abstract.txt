Despite the spread of Creative Commons-licensed content over the internet, people face problems reusing such content because it's often not clear whether the attribution information is present and what permissions, requirements and prohibitions it applies to the content. I propose to create an extension for a web browser that would solve problems described above by signalling that a viewed page contains licensed objects, show license terms, and provide attribution information for those objects.
