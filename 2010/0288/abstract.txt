The goal of my project is to enhance the Python Issue Tracker:

* Creating a new tracker where to test changes, possibly available to all the core developers.
* Implementing new features listed in the metatracker;
* Fixing issues marked as 'bug' in the metatracker;
* Integrating the Issue Tracker with Mercurial;
* Improving its accessibility/usability.
