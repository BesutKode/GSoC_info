OpenMRS supports a great way to integrate Modules into the core system. But these modules are not hot swappable but gives the impression of hotswappable. Each time a module is uploaded, stopped or restarted the OpenMRS system literally restarts itself to put that action into effect. All scheduled tasks and background processes currently running will be interrupted. This project proposes an effective solution for this problem.
