Most of the applications in FreeBSD currently use polling because of limitations of kevent-based file change monitoring (gamin, kde). Kevent approach has the same limitation as Linux' dnotify once had: file or directory should be opened to monitor changes, preventing file system unmounting. I propose to develop a kernel level file system changes notification mechanism for FreeBSD overcoming this limitation.
