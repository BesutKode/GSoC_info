Playing the right tracks at the right time in a perfect mix isn't enough. Users like to use effects in their mix to squeeze every bit of energy, make creative mixes using filters, delay beats, use reverb. The Effects Units, will have standard controls, so we only map MIDI once, and then plug-in the desired effect to use it. The user will also have the flexibility to choose how he's going to use these 2 effects units, being able to use both on a channel, a unit per channel or even both on master.
