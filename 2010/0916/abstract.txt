Development of an improved version of distutils. The project will result in the successful implementation of pep 376, creation of a client which gets meta-data from PyPI via XML-RPC, addition of a 'configure' command, adding pre-post commit hook for installation and un-installation of packages using distutils2, replacement of the `setup.py` script with a `setup.cfg`,and promotion of distutils2 usage by helping a list of projects move over to using distutils2.
