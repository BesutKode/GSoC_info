Hello,

This is Emmanuel Pastor from Mexico, I am a computer engineering studentwho has also worked on the industry for the past four years and a half which has given me a lot of experience that comes from actually knowing the business, dealing with real customers with legitimate concerns and needs. I am not just a student who has some spare time during summer, I have a serious project proposal for you, and I just want to say, it would be my honor if we could work together during summer.
