Distutils2 will replace DistUtils, adding new fonctionalities and bringing some
backwards changes (about design), to distutils1.

The goal of this summer of code is to work on the new distutils2 implementation,
by working on some missing functionalities, and especially by implementing the
PEP 376 [1]. See the list of task to have a complete overview of what will be
done in this GSOC.
