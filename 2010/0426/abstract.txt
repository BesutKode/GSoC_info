A cross platform implementation of the Safe String Library (StrSafe.h) provided by Microsoft. The library will allow multi platform software to use a single library for safe string operations. This will reduce the risk for buffer overflows and will increase code sharing between code for different platforms.

A lot of focus will be put on unit testing of the library thoroughly. This will make it easier to be confident in the correctness of the library.
