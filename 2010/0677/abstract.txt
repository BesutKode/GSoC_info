I am a student at Oregon State University in the Computer Science program. I also DJ locally and on the radio. I feel working on the Mixxx project would be a great experience combining both of these things. I would like to implement a sampler for mix during the GSoC. I think it is a project that would provided work in both underlying code and user-interface design, both of which I am interested in. I am very open to learning new things and working with the mentors to create a quality product.
