The Python 3 version of the Sympy library should allow automatic generation of compiled code for scientific research within quantum physics and chemistry. With increasing computer power, the precision of quantum simulations are often limited by tedious work to derive and implement equations, rather than hardware. Sympy may automate this for python programmers, but the physics modules need significant improvements. New functionality is needed for code generation, as well as a test suite.
