JTor is a Java library implementation of the Tor protocol. Its goal is to provide a lightweight framework for embedding the Tor protocol into applications, part of which includes the capability of hosting and connecting to Tor Hidden Services. For Google Summer of Code 2010, I propose to implement the access and publishing components of Tor Hidden Services in Java as part of JTor.
