For my final university project, I have decided to implement a "Real-time hair simulation and rendering using GPU" application. However, after realizing that there is plenty of work to do, that is not strictly related to my application (such as GUI, 3D models, lights, shadows or anti-aliasing), I have decided that integrating my final project into a graphics engine would be a smart idea.
