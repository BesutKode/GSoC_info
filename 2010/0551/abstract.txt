As a Google Summer of Code participant working on Google Caja, my goal would be to determine what is preventing popular libraries such as MooTools, jQuery, and Prototype from cajoling. Since it seems this task is of a very variable length, I will set my initial goal to determine what is preventing the MooTools core from cajoling, followed by all other classes included with MooTools, and finally (if time permits) moving on to jQuery and others.
