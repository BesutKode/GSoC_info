Good internationalization and localization support is very important for a web application framework. However, most PHP frameworks addresses only basic problems due to the extensiveness of the topic. Because of very loose-coupled architecture and high quality standards, FLOW3 is the best framework for implementing advanced, clean i18n and l10n solution.  I propose to create this kind of solution as my Google Summer of Code 2010 project.
