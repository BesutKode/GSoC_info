Many projects would like to get more out of their Sphinx documentation than the static HTML that is currently generated. Some features that users would like implemented include server side search, commenting, and the ability to receive patches for the documentation from users. A "Web Support Package" that provides an interface to generated Sphinx documentation and these features would be of great benefit to the Python community.
