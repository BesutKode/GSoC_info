The aim of this project is to provide a generic, flexible framework
for initiating and controlling DMA transfers using General Purpose
DMA engines, found in most of embedded SoCs - along with tests and
documentation. There are analogous frameworks for NetBSD (dmover(4))
and Solaris (ddi_dmae(9F)), but they are not well suited for embedded
targets and don't offer all required features.
