Youtube is the most popular video sharing website, right now. VLMC is a video editing software and having features in VLMC to search-retrieve videos, directly upload/update/delete videos on Youtube, within the application itself, would be awesome. The aim of this project is to write a small C++/Qt based Youtube client library for VLMC that provides her all the APIs to perform all those things.
