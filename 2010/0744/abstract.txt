Applescript is a widely used scripting language on the mac platform. It is used for IPC (inter process communication). This enables users who have no idea of programming to create workflows and perform repetitive tasks. By allowing chrome to be scriptable and exposing its API's it enables end-users to seamlessly integrate chrome into their workflows and provides a consistent interface for chrome to communicate with other applications.
