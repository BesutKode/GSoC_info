My aim in this project is to enhance the representation of approximate (estimated) date of birth and date of death in the OpenMRS Electronic Medical Record System. This will allow the users to specify an approximate/estimated date more flexibly and intuitively within the system. Successful completion of this project would allow OpenMRS to store and render internationalized (i18n supported) approximate dates for patient birth dates and dates of death.
