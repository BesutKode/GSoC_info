This project has two goals. The first is to develop an SCXML-to-JavaScript compiler optimized for User Interface development on the World Wide Web. This would allow developers to elegantly describe and implement Web-based UIs with complex behavioural requirements. The second goal is to generate graphical depictions of statecharts, which may then be animated in response to live UI events. This would allow developers to better comprehend the dynamic behaviour described by their statecharts.
