Green Coordinates is a method allowing deformation of an image, by deforming the inside of a polyhedral cage. The technique was exposed in Siggraph 2008. Unlike the other classical method (mean value coordinates, harmonic coordinates, ..), it allows high quality deformation by preserving the shape.

Basic behavior of the tool:
    * you "put" a closed polygon on the image (not limited to 4 handles)
    * you deform the cage, the image is deformed accordingly
