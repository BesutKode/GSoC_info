This proposal will focus Drupal development in the area of Semantic web. The first step in this regard is to empower the taxonomy system with intelligence, make sure that content is tagged accurately, guide and assist authors and moderators in tagging (semi-automatic), auto-tag content, impose guidelines an automated tagging, and learn from existing taxonomy trees within the site and other Drupal sites.
