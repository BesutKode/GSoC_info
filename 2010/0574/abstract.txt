I'd like to work on enhancing Mailman's archives, or more specifically, on generating member statistics, info, and visualizations of such with Google Charts and/or SVG. I'd also like to focus on building a better display for the Mailman Archives, with all messages within a thread being aggregated on a single page. There will be options for flat/nested modes as well as collapsing of messages.
