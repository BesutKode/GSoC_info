I will port the program GNU Shogi to the Android platform, and create a polished touch-friendly interface to it. Shogi is a Japanese board game that belongs to the Chess family. As I am developing the program, I will maintain a blog that will detail the process involved in taking a command-line Linux application and converting it to a portable format. This tutorial series will amplify the effect of my work by teaching others how to port open-source programs to Android.
