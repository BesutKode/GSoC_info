In 2008, one of the SDL Summer of Code projects was to port the SDL library to the iPhone. This year, I would like to accomplish a similar project: porting SDL1.3 to the Android platform. This will greatly benefit mobile developers wishing to target both Android and iPhone, while primarily developing on PC - a scenario that the increasing numbers of Android devices means will become more common. It will also ease the workload on regular developers wanting to port existing SDL apps.
