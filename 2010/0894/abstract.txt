Main idea is to build a physical database modeler for pgAdmin that improve developers productivity. I propose to implement this modeler accomplishing with the Model Driven Application (MDA) architecture, and always thinking in the way to create a shared rendering mini-engine that can be use in the future, under the philosophy of the model view controller (MVC) pattern, to allow introduction of new features at a near future.
