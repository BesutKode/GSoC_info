Proposal of improvement the Triangulation API by: 
Taking the user data types to be attached directly as parameters of the triangulation class instead of using Triangulation_vertex_with_info_3 class
Extending the triangulation classes to manage data attached to facets and edges, even if those elements are not always represented in memory
Extending triangulation classes to enable attaching combined data 
This proposal is an effect of exchanging thoughts with Sylvain Pion.
