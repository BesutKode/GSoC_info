Natural languages can have lexical units which consist of two or more separate words. To handle these lexical units in apertium the concept of multiwords is used. Because the ways in which languages use multiword constructs are so varied, only some cases can be handled with the current dictionary syntax and implementation in apertium. This project aims at extending multiword support in Apertium so that two more major types of multiwords can be handled.
