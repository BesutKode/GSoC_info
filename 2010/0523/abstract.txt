I will introduce several new features that will make PloneFormGen ("PFG" from now on) even easier to use, as well as more stable and more Web 2.0ish. The current version of PFG has couple of pitfalls which I'll be working on towards their removal. The editing of PFG items will introduce new jQuery powered front-end and it'll make it easier for the average user to change the order of the form items, as well as easily modify any of them.
