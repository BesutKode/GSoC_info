My name is Lucas Nascimento Ferreira, I am student of Computer Science and I have worked with multiseat over the last 3 years in MDM project. I would like to work in the "USB Multiseat Refinement" idea because in Brazil multiseats are becoming very common on public schools, but they are having many problems with this. This project plan includes study the state of the upstream pieces nowadays and, using the existing source code of Plugable solution, implement a clear USB Multiseat solution.
