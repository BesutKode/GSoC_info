Imagine the world where computer systems are handling all critical situations. It is required that those systems are tested by powerful verification tools. In order to maximize application reliability, production version should not differ from testing version. Achievement of that is possible using annotations which are detected on runtime. Aim of Checking Java Annotation project is to develop set of annotations that can be applied to Java programs to assist tools that detect software defects.
