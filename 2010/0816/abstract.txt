Currently the Gallery on OOo isn't in its best shape - besides some minor usability flaws, its major disadvantage is that the content is limited to what's shipped with the product. 
The major part of this project would be to connect the existing gallery to a website (most probably www.opencliparts.org) providing fresh and interesting content, and displaying it within the client application itself. 
Another part could include fixing some smaller issues with the gallery UI itself.
