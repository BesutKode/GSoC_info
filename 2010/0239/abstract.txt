The plug-in will allow easy insertion of code snippets into the Anjuta IDE editor and will have enough options to benefit the easy management of those snippets. By management I mean: easy browsing trough the existing snippets, editing them, importing new ones and exporting them into snippet packages so those snippets can be shared. The snippets themselves will be interactive.
