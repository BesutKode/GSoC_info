Some VLC demuxers could be improved, especially with seeking to I-frames and supporting new or rarely seen formats. This project aims to improve the Matroska and ASF demuxers in particular. Main working methods are browsing the bugtracker and writing tests and finding test files for the current code, and most important of all communicating with the people involved. Alternative refactored versions of both Matroska and ASF plugins are also introduced for possible merging.
