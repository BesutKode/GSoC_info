The main goal of the proposed project is to improve the user experience by cutting down the loading time at the program startup. This is to be achieved by caching prescaled SVG images on harddisk and using a worker thread to asynchronously load sprites for menus. The second goal is to convert some of the existing PNG sprites to SVG format, improving its portability to different resolutions.
