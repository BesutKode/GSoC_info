The goal of this project is to have a functioning port of gccgo to RTEMS. The aim is to make the port work on atleast one architecture supported by RTEMS with comprehensive testing done on this port. If this aim is met, then other architectures will be considered. Documentation and a HOWTO will be provided giving build instructions. Patches will be added into RTEMS, newlib and the gccgo projects as and when needed.
