My proposal is to create a uniform and centralized GUI for the samba administrative utilities and to modify gregedit (the remote registry editing tool) so that it resembles the windows utility for registry editing. I also plan to add basic import/export functionality to the gregedit tool. If I find that I have progressed quickly on this project then I will also create all current GUI in Glade XML format so they are easier to edit in the future. I hope my proposal is of interest to you!
