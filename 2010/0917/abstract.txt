The 2to3 utility has been written to help convert python 2.x programs into working python 3.x programs. However, the tool currently uses inefficient matching algorithms that significantly negatively impact the execution time especially for large projects. This project aims to collect performance data about 2to3, then replace the existing matching algorithm with an algorithm based on state machines that should provide significantly improved performance.
