A Ptex file stores multiple textures in multiple resolutions for each face in the model's mesh. With Ptex in Blender artists can paint textures for arbitrary complex models without worrying about UVs. Intrinsic per-face UVs are used to provide a proper texel distribution. Ptex takes care of filtering textures with different resolutions. Since Ptex has been designed for use with subdivision models using Catmull-Clark, the Blender integration needs to be combined with the multires modifier.
