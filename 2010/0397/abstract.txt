The goal of this project is the integration of important phylogenetic tools for ancestral state reconstruction and rate testing into a commonly used scripting environment (R).  R is an ideal place to port the functions contained in Brownie due to it's robust linkage to C/C++ (innately and through external packages) and because of it's potential to act as a staging area for all steps in phylogenetic data analysis, from reading in genetic data to running analyses to plotting the results.
