JPF can verify various temporal properties, yet it hasn’t supported of generic temporal property verification (LTL or CTL). Presently,LTL-translator extension has implemented; however, Buechis received are quite generic, so there haven’t been any extension to check them. Thus, user must implement a corresponding listener to each property they want to verify. Hence, I propose a JPF extension that furnishes generic support for LTL and provide simpler way of concrete temporal property verification.
