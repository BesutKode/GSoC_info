An existing Scilab library for manipulating graphs and performing various graph algorithms – Metanet – is currently implemented in Fortran, C & Java, but doesn't take advantage of The Boost Graph Library. The part that's implemented in Fortran (and also C) wouldn't hurt some performance improvement which could be very significant when using it on large scaled graphs. The main part of the project would be to change the Fortran implementation, to use the BGL.
