primary concern of this project is to cover up the core functionalities of the logistics. Basically, a person who logs in to the system will need ways to send Items/shipment, receive Items/shipments, request Items and monitor warehouse Items. Hence, I would implement the Logistics Site Functionality Idea along with the basic Item catalogue. These functions will fulfil the primary needs of the logistics module, allowing the proper management of logistics according to the needs of the situation.
