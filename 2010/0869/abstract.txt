The recent rework of OpenOfficeâ€™s binary MS Word .doc (WW8) export filter made it easy to extend for other MS Word formats, like DOCX. In particular, using the advantages of the shared code to implement a new RTF export filter based on this rework is certainly possible to implement - and this summer I would like to work on this.
