Mobile web browsers are distinct from desktop browsers in many ways.  Because of this it is important that developers do not conceptually treat interfaces and validation the same for both platforms.   As mobile devices become more prominent, the demand for well built, mobile optimized websites is going to increase. Because of this I propose the development of an API/Framework with a small footprint for quickly creating dynamic and intuitive user interfaces optimized for mobile devices.
