The proposed project is to add support for stereoscopic video to GStreamer.  This support will come from three plugins: one merging two separate streams in a single 3D stream, one splitting a 3D stream into two separate streams and third one converting a 3D stream into an analglyph stream viewable with red-blue or red-cyan glasses.  Support for the Multiview Video Coding (MVC) of H.264/AVC will also be added with encoder and decoder plugins.
