Most of the add-on modules available when installed might not be used or may be wished not to be used or be removed as the work intended with a particular module has been done . This project would aim to develop a Module manager to manipulate the way-to-use of the modules in Sahana from installing,uninstalling and disabling modules.Also to provide Sahana with "App Store"  which will be the improved version of the basic Module manager
