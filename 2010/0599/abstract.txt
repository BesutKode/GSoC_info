The scope of this project is to implement support for the D-Bus IPC mechanism in the gnustep-base library. GNUstep already has a powerful IPC mechanism called "Distributed Objects", but supporting D-Bus as well has additional benefits: By providing a similar API for both DO and D-Bus, GNUstep applications can transparently access existing D-Bus services (such as HAL) or expose their own functionality to non-GNUstep applications, therefore integrating more seamlessly into a user's desktop.
