This project intends to implement the Data Terminal role of the Dial-up Network profile on the linux stack. The DUN profile provides a standard to connect to the Internet and other dial-up services over Bluetooth technology. A example is use the Internet from a cell phone on your laptop via a dial-up connection. The goal is to implement the DUN client as a plugin inside oFono (a linux telephony stack) and if we have time the DUN Server(the Gateway role).
