The static control part detection algorithm that is currently implemented in Graphite operates directly on the control flow graph and divides it into single entry single exit parts that meet all the requirements introduced by the polyhedral representation. That approach proved to be too specific and hard to extend. The main goal of the proposed project is to choose a better and more flexible region-based algorithm and implement it.
