JSON is a text serialization format similar in purpose to XML.  PostgreSQL already has an XML datatype, along with XML access and manipulation functions such as xmlconcat, xmlforest, etc..  I propose adding a JSON datatype and related functions to PostgreSQL.  Because JSON's structure is somewhat different than XML's, the json* functions will likely be different.  When this project is completed, it will add a JSON datatype to PostgreSQL along with ways to convert sets to/from JSON.
