PathVisio is an open source pathway visualization tool which is the central editor for WikiPathways. As many new pathways are being generated using PathVisio, a more intuitive and powerful user interface will accelerate the pathway creation and data analysis process. In this Google Summer of Code event, I would like to contribute to the improvement of PathVisio user interface (the proposed IDEA 4).
