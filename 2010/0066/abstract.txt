Nepomuk makes maintenance and intensive usage of meta-data possible. Building on this, it provides powerful search tools, though the representation of search results is not user-friendly or intuitive enough, especially for non-technical users. We propose a reusable search GUI that presents results in a relevant and appealing manner. We aim to deal with specific popular cases (files, emails, contacts, tasks, etc.) to present search results in an appealing manner.
