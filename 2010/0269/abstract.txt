GNUstep has had a modular graphics backend system (GNUstep-back) for many years, supporting several vector graphics libraries on X11 and Windows, and an API inspired by Display PostScript. However, GNUstep's relative Cocoa uses an API called CoreGraphics which is a better fit for modern graphics hardware.

My project is to modernize GNUstep-back, first by finishing the Opal library (a subproject of GNUstep implementing the CoreGraphics API.) Secondly, I will refactor GNUstep-back to use Opal.
