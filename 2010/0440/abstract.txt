DocBook is a set of standards and tools for technical documentation. A vital requirement for technical publications is to produce a Web-based help format that is synchronized with the content automatically. So the documentation is up-to-date and makes site maintenance easier. This will contain client-side searching with support for stemming, table of contents, Index and a HTML export ability. The main idea is to generate a Web Help Output from the DocBook content XML files using an Ant build.
