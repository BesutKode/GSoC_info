The development targets the integration Atutor (Learning Management System) and OpenCaps (web-based captioning tool). The integration will use a modular architecture and deliver a component providing Atutorâ€™s instructors access to OpenCaps captioning services. The core idea is a communication and administration layer reusing current functionality, and not modifying the core files in the existing applications. This will allow easy and secure installation as well as future upgrades.
