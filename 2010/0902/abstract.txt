I am a graduate student from Singapore. My main reasons for participating are:
1) My personal interest in IT security (hence my work in this field)
2) I have the relevant knowledge and skills
3) What better way to spend my free time!
My proposed implementations for TraceXploit are explained. The proposals are realistic enough to be achieved in 3months. 
It would be an exciting experience and challenge to look forward to if I could be selected as a GSoC-Honeynet 2010 participant.
