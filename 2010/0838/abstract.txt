Currently, very few, if any, optimizations are automatically applied by Parrot to code running on it. Any optimizations must be implemented in the specific compilers or at a low level, resulting in some compilers, such as Not Quite Perl, lacking even very useful optimizations such as tail call elimination. With a simple common framework for easily implementing optimizations, it will be much easier for HLLs on Parrot to be optimized more powerfully and perform more quickly.
