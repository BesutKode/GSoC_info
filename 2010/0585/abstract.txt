The aim of this project is to develop a syntax rewriter plugin which can converts MySQL dumps to scripts.A lot of data types and commands have been removed in drizzle to make Drizzle into a lean, mean query-running machine. Drizzleâ€™s aim is to keep focused on MySQL's original goals of ease-of-use, reliability and performance. But these changes make MySQL dumps incompatible with drizzle and create problems to users who want to shift to Drizzle. This project will help them in shifting to drizzle.
