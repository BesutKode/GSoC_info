distutils2 is a replacement for the standard distutils package. This  project will not focus solely on one particular component, but will rather implement several features that are essential to the project but are still missing. Furthermore, a tutorial will be created that will ease the migration to the distutils2. Finally, a list of projects will be chosen and I will help them make the transition to distutils2.
