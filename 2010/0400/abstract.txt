Free software is a very important pice in the education for the world. TuxHistory aims to cover a important lack. Free Software doesn't have a history learning game! The idea is make a strategy game that uses the real time strategy mode like Age of Empire (all in 2d), but should be focused on a economic, cultural, military and science development of the different civilizations. Establish some civilizations and ages of development of each civilization.
