Bespin for Drupal (B4D) introduces Mozilla's web-based, collaborative code editor, Bespin, with Drupal 7. This proposal delivers two Drupal Modules:
1) B4D Server implements Bespin Server's API using Drupal Services Module and perhaps WYSIWYG API.
2) B4D Client provides Drupal configuration and integration of the Bespin Client.

Depending on progress the proposal may also provide a Bespin PHP syntax highlighting library.
