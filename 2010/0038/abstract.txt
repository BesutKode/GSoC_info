Automatic sync between Sahana instances has received much attention from Sahana community. It aims to sync resources between multiple Sahana instances. I will work on resolving its current issues and adding new features:

(1) Make sync peer discovery work over WANs & LANs by combining ZeroConf with Beacon Service (an online directory of Sahana instances)
(2) Modifying sync process to work with S3XRC resources instead of DB tables to maintain full references
(3) Offline Sync facility (USB)
