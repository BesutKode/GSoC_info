The main goal of this project is to rewrite TP python server to use Twisted Network Framework. Twisted is a full featured event-driven platform suited at writing network application. Reimplementing TP python server with Twisted will bring many benefits including: increased performance and responsibility, ease of adding new features to TP protocol and server, better code maintainability. This project might be crucial for convenience of TP gamers using current python server implementation.
