I will revive the currently dead portage GUI Kuroo.
It will be ported to Qt 4, and to the new portage API.
The goal is to have a Qt based portage GUI again as most of the current ones
are GTK+ based. That will give KDE users a better solution when they want a
graphical user interface for their gentoo.
