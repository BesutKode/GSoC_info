Bio::Align::AlignI and Bio::Assembly were developed during the early stage of BioPerl, which deal with sequence alignment/assembly files. However, several problems were reported concerning these two packages, especially from the growing number of BioPerl packages and huge amount of sequencing data generated in the next generation sequencing projects. In this project, we aim to refactor the package, to increase the compability and working efficiency of the packages.
