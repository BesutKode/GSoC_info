This project aims to provide an implementation to replace links to videos (from sources like Youtube, DailyMotion, VBOX7, Facebook etc) and images (from sources like Flickr and direct links to images) during a chat to the corresponding preview images. The essence of the project lies in forming an architecture that should be abstract enough to facilitate easy extension for addition of various sources ( eg. new video/image websites) later on.
