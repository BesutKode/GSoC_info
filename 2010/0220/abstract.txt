Idea is to develop an emacs like editor with the org specific semantics for the purpose of note taking & authoring. Applying the rules of Org notations, it can also be extended to incorporate gnowsys-mode as it currently works in emacs. Export like features of Org-mode will be made possible in this editor by communicating through local emacs server. All the gnowsys-mode specific commands will pass on the request to the GNOWSYS server via local emacs daemon.
