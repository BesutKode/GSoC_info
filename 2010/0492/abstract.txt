Domain-Specific Languages are easy to implement with Groovy, which offers various techniques and approaches for that purpose. We have discussed a Groovy Extension Proposal (GEP-3) for extending Groovy's "command expression" syntax to make for even nicer and more language natural like Domain-Specific Languages. The purpose of this project is to try to implement this proposal, learning along the way about the internals of Groovy, the Antlr parser, dynamic languages, and DSLs.
