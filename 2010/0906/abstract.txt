To help Derby become perfect, it's important to fix existing bugs and replace existing logic in the Derby test harness with JUnit code. With the new JUnit tests, Derby would gain all the benefits of JUnit, such as running tests from ant, integration with IDEs, ability to hook into other JUnit suites, easier understanding of how Derby tests are run etc. 

Current conversion focuses on LOB tests and tests in tests/derbynet/, tests/lang/, tests/jdbcapi and existing SQL scripts.
