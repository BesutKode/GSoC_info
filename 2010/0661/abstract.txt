The goal of this project is to create a useful, extensible, and stable Eclipse plugin for Randoop that increases the usability of the tool and seamlessly integrates into the Eclipse environment.  The plugin, titled Ecloop, will add a new layer of functionality that allows the user to easily define and manage Randoop’s input and output.  By the end of this project, Ecloop will be integrated with JUnit and EclEmma to provide detailed information on the tests’ results.
