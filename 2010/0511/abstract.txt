This project aims the development of a web application to enable easy collaborative work on TuxPaint Stamps. Through this application, photographers and artists will be able to upload their "raw" work, making it available for others to finish. This application will support license management of the uploaded files and will keep a history of modification. Finished files will be moved to a gallery, from where a synchronization mechanism on Tux Paint will be able to download them.
