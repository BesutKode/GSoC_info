ScummVM has grown to include support for adventure games running on many different engines. This much-appreciated support has unfortunately bloated the size of the ScummVM binary and the space it takes up in RAM, which is a problem for small devices that don't have much RAM to work with. To alleviate this issue, custom module loaders can be written for these devices that enable them to only load one needed engine into RAM at a time, depending on the game selected.
