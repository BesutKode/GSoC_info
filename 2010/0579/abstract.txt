The WMA codec officially has 4 flavours :
    - WMA
    - WMA Professional
    - WMA lossless
    - WMA voice
         
The project aims primarily to add support for WMA professional in
Rockbox, and streamline its power consumption and memory usage.
        
As a secondary goal, if time allowed, a port of WMA voice could be
started too, but due to the size of such codec it's not guaranteed to be
fully working by the end of the project.
