Apache Xerces2-J XML Schema processor currently provides support for W3C XML Schema specification 1.1. Although it fulfils more than spec's minimal requirement ,some vital XML Schema Structures support is yet to be realized. This project tries to implement one such requirement, namely  xs:override support for XML Schema 1.1 .The xs:override semantics are intended for unconstrained Schema component replacement , mitigating some of the bottlenecks in existing structures such as xs:redefine.
