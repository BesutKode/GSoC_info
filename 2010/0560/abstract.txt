wxRichTextCtrl aims to provide a generic implementation of a rich text editor that can handle different character styles, paragraph formatting, and images. With this project I will I will implement a class to support the basic operation control for the image’s size, alignment and float options. What’s more, images will be able to floated in the project buffer in proper order and genetic layout algorithm that could later be used to wrap text around image and other objects.
