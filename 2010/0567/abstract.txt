Chart implementation in the following places of phpMyAdmin:
charts in server status page, showing query type statistics
charts showing query results
charts showing query execution time structure

Open Flash Chart project and GD library would be used for generating charts. Code structure would be modular allowing easy addition of new chart types and chart generating back-ends.
