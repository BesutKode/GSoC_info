A graphical application for processing data and generating visualizations and summary statistics from data transfer records. The application would be used to create and edit report schemas that define what statistics and visualizations are generated from the data. The aim is not to replicate data mining and visualization software implemented elsewhere, but to leverage them through plugins and to produce a simple UI for visualizing data mining results and generating reports.
