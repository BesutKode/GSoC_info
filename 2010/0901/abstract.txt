When 9vx was released some years ago it was presented as an experiment, a demostration of what was possible combining vx32 and Plan9. Time passed by and, today, the 9vx experiment can be considered a sucess: it is replacing drawterm in many Unix systems, is a good test bed for experimentation and trying Plan 9 is easier than ever. The objective of this project is to integrate into the 9vx source some improvements done by 9fans and explore how to make it better.
