The project paves a way to combine the demands in high performance
computing with the dynamics of compute clouds with Debian.
Combining the Eucalyptus cloud computing infrastructure
with the TORQUE resource manager and preparing the components for
dynamically added and removed instances provides the user with a
attractive high performance computing environment.
Such a system allows users to share resources with large
compute centers with minimal changes in their workflow and scripts.
