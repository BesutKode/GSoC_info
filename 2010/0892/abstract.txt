A mobile client for the Dreamwidth platform, this application allows users of Dreamwidth to access their accounts from their favored Apple mobile product.  Notable features include the ability to log into and move between multiple user accounts easily, read and write posts to Dreamwidth communities, and cache posts for reading even when offline.  The application will be open sourced and submitted for release on the Apple App Store by the end of Google's Summer of Code.
