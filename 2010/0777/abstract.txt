This proposal identifies Java serialization and blocking IO as 
the two main potential performance bottlenecks in the current 
implementation of remote actors in Scala, and suggests separate, 
but relevant summer projects to deal with each issue. 
Other relevant existing open source projects are discussed, 
and while some ideas are borrowed, the main idea is that 
these projects do not address both of these issues together, 
which makes this particular summer project proposal unique.
