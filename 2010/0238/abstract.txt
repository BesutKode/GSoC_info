The objective of this project is to add a range analysis to LLVM. The range analysis finds the intervals that integer variables used in the source program may assume. Such analysis has many clients, such as array-bound-check elimination, buffer overflow detection, improving register allocation, etc. I propose to implement the polynomial time analysis described by Zhendong and Wagner in the paper "A class of polynomially solvable range constraints for interval analysis without widening".
