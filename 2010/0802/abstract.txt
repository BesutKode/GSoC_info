The goal of this project is to provide Unit Tests for all of the underlying parts of the Blender API. Furthermore, if time permits, this project will attempt to clean up the more stable portions of the Blender API, and expand upon the current state of Blender development documentation.  The project will be divided into three main sections, building the tests, converging the tests, and improving developer documentation.
