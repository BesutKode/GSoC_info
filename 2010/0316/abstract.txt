Mifos is a neat Spring/Hibernate stack based application. In the last year alone there have been loads of development in Spring framework (with 3.0 and introduction of Spring ROO as an amalgamation of best practices approach to rapid application development). This is a proposal to Mifos community for a project which can explore Spring ROO based proof of concept for next generation Mifos.
