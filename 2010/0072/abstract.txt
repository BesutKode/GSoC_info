The objective of git-remote-svn is to provide native interaction with SVN repositories in Git, the motivation for which comes from the shortcomings of git-svn. I intend to do this by building a remote helper for SVN. Several good SVN exporters already exist, and using one of them with a remote helper should eliminate a lot of the plumbing that git-svn tackles by hand. Also, using a remote helper to interact will provide a simple and natural UI at no additional cost.
