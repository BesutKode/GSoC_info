The Locator/ID Separation Protocol (LISP) implements a separation of the Internet addresses into Endpoint Identifiers (EID) and Routing Locators (RLOC) in an attempt to solve the problem of routing scalability on the Internet, and also provide new approach to other routing problems like multihoming, renumbering of clients and traffic engineering. The goal of this project is to implement this protocol in the Linux kernel.
