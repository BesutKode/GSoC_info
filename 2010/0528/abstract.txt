This projectâ€™s aim is to study the current state saving performance of MyFaces  2.0 and to find where this could be improved and the means by which it can be done. The first steps for improving the state-saving performance were already made by introducing partial state saving. This way, the memory consumption is reduced. More detailed measures should be done at first and determine what else might be improved. Then, these improvements should be implemented.
