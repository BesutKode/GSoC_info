Sugar on a Stick is a project that "enables children to reclaim computers". It's a project that reaches even further than other approaches seen before, as it significantly lowers the entry barrier for people to get their hands on their own personalized Sugar Learning Experience. This proposal aims at reaching out for more feedback and interaction through existing and established upstream projects and integrating those in the Sugar Platform.
