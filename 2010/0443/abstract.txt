The goal of this project is to create a georeferencing library for parsing and displaying geographical and phylogenetic information. The main aim of the project is to bring together geographical and phylogenetic information in a way that is usable and useful to the user. Given an input of a tree file and geographical information the library will return a tree with phylogenetic and geographical information in a format such as KML or shapefile or a georeferenced phylogenetic format such as neXML.
