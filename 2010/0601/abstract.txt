My Name is Nils Gey and I want to help out GNU Denemo during the GSoC.
I am a student of Music at the Music University of Cologne, Germany and I am a programmer as well.

The Denemo Idea to add MusicXML Import (and probably more formats) is the right thing for me. 
I fit perfectly in the description listed here http://denemo.org/index.php/Summer_Of_Code_2010 .
