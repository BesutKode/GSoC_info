Writers need tools that go beyond paper-based paradigms to create genuinely “computeral” documents.  This project proposes a system for AbiWord documents to arrange custom-sized pages in arbitrary spatial configurations.  Two new document views, Canvas Layout and Structured Layout, will enable users to navigate their document spatially and through a node graph visualization.  If time permits, I hope to lay the groundwork for a modular system to add pages from various digital sources directly.
