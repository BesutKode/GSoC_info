This project is about implementing a larger set of features specific to vim and to integrate them in Kate. Among the improvements:

* a feature that limits the effects of crashes by creating swap files
* a visual diff for visualizing the changes that happen to a file while editing
* extend Erlend Hamberg's work - the "Vi-mode" and add new features such as visual block selection and improve others such as searching and the whole interaction between Vi-mode and Kate's interface and commands
