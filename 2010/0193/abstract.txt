Aim for this project is to build hardware accelerated kind of engine for 2D drawing system for Scala. Using advantage that Scala is compatible with Java, in this case JOGL which is Java bindings for OpenGL would be use. To achieve possible high performance with well-look and "fancy" effect I plan to use great innovation for graphic libraries - shaders. That 2D engine will be API which will lets users customise shaders for all rendered objects (primitives, images, figures etc).
