My idea is to provide for Wine project fully functional equivalent of Windows Game Explorer and it's COM interfaces. In the future lot of games will probably need GE and it's APIs to work properly. Working Game Explorer may be also very useful for users. Project includes implementation of Game Definition Files parser, local games database, GE COM APIs and Game Explorer itself as Shell Extension. Implementation of Legacy Games Support equivalent is possible too.
