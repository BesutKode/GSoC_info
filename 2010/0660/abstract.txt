ClearMaps is an ActionScript framework for interactive cartographic visualization. The project aims to address some of the common technical challenges faced when building interactive, data driven maps for the web. The objective of the project is to include the line simplification that prevent the creation of gaps between adjacent polygons to have smooth lines and curves in the map such that it loads quickly into ClearMaps Builder.
