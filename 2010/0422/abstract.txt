services-admin, currently included in the GNOME system tools, is a great utility to easily enable and disable services. However, it lacks the ability to manage Upstart jobs, making it less useful on some systems.
The goal of this project is to provide a unified interface, in services-admin and backends, for managing both older scripts and Upstart jobs.
Additionally, an interface will be provided that allows users to easily change service-specific configuration without editing files by hand.
