Tahoe-LAFS is a perfect platform for distributing web applications which are highly dependant on user's data and require no server-side capabilities. I plan to write a fully featured music player which embraces the social components of the web while retaining privacy and security provided by Tahoe-LAFS. This application should be just a glimpse of what can be built on top of Tahoe-LAFS: highly interactive applications providing alternative views to files stored in Tahoe-LAFS.
