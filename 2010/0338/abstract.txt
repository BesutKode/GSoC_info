RPy2 is an interface between Python and the statistical package R. This project aims to port existing functionality of RPy2 to Python 3 as well as to improve integration by taking advantage of Python 3's features. It will be completed in three stages: porting RPy2's existing functionality, integrating new features of Python and its C API (MemoryViews, PyCapsules, ordered dictionaries) and lastly implementing an R graphical device which would be able to interface with Matplotlib.
