Modern programming systems need to provide support for both parallel execution on multiprocessor systems and concurrent programming style to model naturally concurrent problems. This project will implement a threading system for Parrot that will allow a large number of logically concurrent tasks to execute efficiently on multiple physical processors by multiplexing many concurrent tasks to a smaller set of OS threads.
