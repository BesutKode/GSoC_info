My interests are in object category recognition and retrieval, and after spending the past eight months working with the OpenCV library in this area I'm now keen to get involved in contributing to its development. By participating in GSoC, I hope to build upon my own experience in recognition, improve my skills as a coder and get to know the OpenCV community, learning more about the open source development methodology and how to become an effective contributer.
