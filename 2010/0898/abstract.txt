NeXML, is a data exchange format for phylogenetics, developed to overcome the problems posed by the existing formats. RDF is a data model used to represent metadata. NeXML by design supports the concept of RDF triples. The goal of the project is to:
1. Implement a NeXML parser/serialzer in BioRuby.
2. Develop an API to express RDF triples in BioRuby.
