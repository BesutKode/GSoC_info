Taking advantage of Playdar's ability to find content from a variety of sources, this project intends to create a new Amarok collection that seamlessly displays all content which Playdar can browse so that a user can see and use local, network, and some internet content all at once, just as they do their local collection. Additionally, a user's searches will reveal content from sources which don't support browsing.
