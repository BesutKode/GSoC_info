State Chart XML (SCXML) provides a generic state-machine based execution environment based on Harel State Tables.It is very useful to handler complex status transfer logic,but if a SCXML file is really so huge and complex,it will become too difficult to maintain and refactor or to test its logic validity.This project aims to provide a Eclipse and GMF based Visual Editor and Debugger for SCXML,and we can also use it to generate SCXML document and specific codes according to a State Chart XML.
