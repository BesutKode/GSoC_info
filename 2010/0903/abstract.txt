This project involves developing new techniques for visualizing the residual coverage, the source-code portions that are not yet covered, in JPF. Visualization helps JPF users by assisting users in navigating both code under test and test code, thereby assisting users to understand and infer reasons of why certain code portions are not covered. This project will be implemented as an Eclipse plug-in by using Eclipse Visualization Toolkit including SWT, GEF, and Zest.
