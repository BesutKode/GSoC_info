I will work on the write support for the dwg format in the LibreDWG project. Since the reading of the format is almost entirely implemented, the writing has become a priority. With that in mind I intend to create the file structure with the readers and features necessary. The objects, entities and most part of data structures are already implemented, so this work aims to glue all together and create the files according to each version specification.
