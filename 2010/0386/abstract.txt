My project aims for a complete implementation of the object-oriented features of the Fortran 2003 standard in gfortran, focusing on polymorphism. Such an implementation has been started last year and has partly entered the GCC 4.5 release already, but it is not yet complete and still has a couple of open issues. The primary goal is a complete and bug-free implementation of basic polymorphism. The long-term goal is the completion of all OOP-related F2003 features.
