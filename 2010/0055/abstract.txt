There are plenty of calendars like desktop clients or the on-line ones, but I'd like the Dreamwidth one to be unusual.

The calendar should be used – so it should be intuitive, practical. The calendar should be personal – so it should be configurable. And the DwCalendar should be not another calendar – so I'd like it to be created with a lot of cooperation of Dreamwidth Members, I'd like it to hold concepts that would give it its own personality.
