The Ext-Scr. module enables developers either to use a scripting language to develop JSF applications or to use Java in a way as if it was a scripting language as well. This works thanks to dependency graphs being built internally reflecting the current state of the application. Having said that, this project aims to enable developers to use an implementation of the CDI specification with Apache MyFaces Ext-Scripting, i.e. this project basically provides the meta data information it requires.
