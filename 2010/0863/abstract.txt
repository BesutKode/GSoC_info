Every PostScript printer needs a PPD file to work. With hundreds (and more) of supported printers, there're many files. In a typical Ubuntu installation, they count for about 60 MB of space. This is almost 10% of the capacity of a CD, the usual GNU/Linux distribution's media of choice. As more printers are made every year, there is a growing need to find a way to compress these files. This proposal explains my solution.
