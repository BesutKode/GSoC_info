IPinUDP encapsulation is a well known encapsulation mechanism mainly used for NAT traversal solutions (e.g.: RFC 3948). Moreover, IP/UDP encapsulation can be envisioned in end-to-end overlays and mobility management solutions. Despite its simplicity, a generic IPinUDP encapsulation Linux Kernel module independent from the IPsec framework is not currently available. With this work, I propose the implementation of a new IPinUDP encapsulation module exporting virtual network devices to user-space.
