SymPy will benefit greatly by having a complete framework for symbolic quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics is a theory that describes the behavior of physical systems at the atomic scale and smaller. The mathematics of quantum mechanics has many aspects of linear algebra built into it, and like any math, calculations can be performed with abstract symbols resulting in intuitive results. By the end of the summer, the base layer for symbolic quantum mechanics in SymPy will be finished.
