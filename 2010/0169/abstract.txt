As Crystal Space relies primarily on software algorithms to do the culling, a new hardware culler would be a good addition to the engine's feature list. As such new, more modern, algorithms, such as CHC++, which take advantage of hardware capabilities offered by new generation graphics chipsets would have to be implemented. A new improved hardware augmented culler will be delivered as the final product of this project, which would boost the rendering performance and strength of Crystal Space.
