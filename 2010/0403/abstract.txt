Community Core Audio(CCA) is an openframeworks based solution for voice user interface. 

CCA manages voice inputs, converts voice to text, and outputs messages to network.

CCA will use the similar UI and workflow with CCV. They stay seperate but they can work together. People may use them both and experiment with computer vision and audio.

A stand alone openframeworks addon, ofxASR, will be developed as well. ofxASR will be the Automatic Speech Recognition(ASR) engine for CCA.
