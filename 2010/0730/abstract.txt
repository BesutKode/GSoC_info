Google Wave is a real-time collaboration system based upon operational transformation approach to replicated state synchronization. With the Cola System, ECF has been using operational transformation, for some time now. I propose to implement a provider to allow an equinox+ecf based web server to inter-operate with Google Wave. Like I read in Bugzilla there are many people who would like to have this feature implemented. The provider is also part of the official ECF project-plan / roadmap.
