Implementation of two new chat interface plugins for StatusNet.

Windows Messenger
Windows Messenger is very popular among those with less technical skills who may otherwise not use the chat interface functions. Implementing this plugin would open the chat interface functions to a new audience of users.

IRC
After discussion in the IRC channel, it is clear that there is demand for an IRC plugin.

Both the plugins will use the same commands as the existing XMPP plugin.
