Non-relational databases tend to support some subset of the operations that are
supported on relational databases, therefore it should be possible to perform
these operations on all databases.  Some people are of the opinion that we
shouldn't bother to support these databases, because they can't perform all
operations, I'm of the opinion that the abstraction is already a little leaky,
we may as well exploit this for a common API where possible.
