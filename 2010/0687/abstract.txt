Testdrive is a project that makes it very easy to download the daily Ubuntu Development snapshot and run it in a Virtual Machine, allowing non-technical Ubuntu users to test and provide feedback. It can also be configured to download and run any URL-access ISO. It is written in Python, but only has a command line interface. This project would consist of constructing a PyGTK frontend for Testdrive. However, before that's possible, it first needs to be modularized.
