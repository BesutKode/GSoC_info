I propose to design an anomaly detection engine by wrapping the c++ library for anomaly detection system, libAnomaly in cython. This engine can then be utilized from phoneyC to detect unknown attacks with high degree of confidence and low false positive rate. Thus a lot of interesting things can be done like detecting previously unknown attacks, deobfuscated JS code, characterize exploit, generate exploit signature etc.
