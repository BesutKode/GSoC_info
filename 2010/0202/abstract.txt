Caching is a key ingredient to scale web applications, a simple principle that avoids dbms access if the same query is being executed over and over. The goal of this project is to create a query cache plug-in for Drizzle, that will permit to scale out the memory by storing results of redundant queries in a cache repository like memcached, then return the cached results to clients if the same request is executed, thus without having to parse and execute the query again.
