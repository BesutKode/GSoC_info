If one follows the news and blog posts about VoIP security it becomes apparent that attacks on VoIP systems are getting more popular among malicious hackers and criminals. Dionaea is a low-interaction honeypot that exposes known vulnerabilities to the network. Once an attacker attempts to exploit these software flaws Dionaea tries to capture the malware from the network. My project will improve and extend Dionaea with a module that allows to detect and capture common VoIP attacks.
