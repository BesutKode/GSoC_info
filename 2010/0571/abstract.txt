Lighter2 module currently supports direct lighting for lightmap calculation. Though some work has been done previously on implementing global illumination using photon mapping. Its not yet in good enough condition. I would like to extend the photon mapping module to include support for area and polygon lights. And support for different types of materials like caustics and filtering materials.
