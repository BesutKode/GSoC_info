The current version of the DocBook XSL stylesheets is written in XSLT 1.0 and is heavily relying on XSLT processor specific extensions. The aim of this proposal is to extend and finish existing prototype XSLT 2.0 implementation so it offers similar functionality for HTML, FO and ePub output formats in terms of features and parametrization as the current XSLT 1.0 based version of the stylesheets. Also support for new DocBook V5.0 features will be implemented.
