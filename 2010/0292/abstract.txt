Decentralized introduction can effectively distribute the task of introducing new nodes and thus Tahoe-LAFS can get rid of the problem of single-point of load and single-point failure (Issue #68). Here we propose to implement  a publish/subscribe style algorithm that can enable multiple introducers to share the load of introduction tasks in a decentralized way.  Scalability analysis,  verification through simulation/experimentation and performance testing is also included here.
