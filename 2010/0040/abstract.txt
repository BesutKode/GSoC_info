The proposed project replaces the old magical item system with a new one. The new system will add sockets to weapons and armor and introduce a new add-on item type that can be mounted to a socket. Items will be modified to have sockets, and add-ons will be made available in-game. Add-ons will come in many varieties, including simple stat bonus add-ons, generic purpose special add-ons such as a light-radius improver, and item type specific add-ons such as a rapid fire add-on for ranged weapons.
