SymPy, a computer algebra system written and executed in Python, currently has decent heuristic support for symbolic integration.  However, the integrator is slow, and being a heuristic, can often fail to find an elementary integral for a function when there is one, even in simple cases.  I plan to improve SymPyâ€™s integrator by improving the heuristics as well as implementing some of the Risch algorithm, which will guarantee elementary results if they exist.
