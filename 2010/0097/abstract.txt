Currently Mediawiki only supports displaying jpeg exif metadata on image pages. Some other metadata can also be returned using the api prop=imageinfo&iiprop=metadata, however this is not that useful to the average viewer since it is not displayed. I propose as my project (should I be accepted and all that) to improve Mediawiki's support for metadata of uploaded files. This would include extracting metadata for more media formats, and displaying the metadata on image pages where it is useful.
