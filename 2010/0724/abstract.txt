olsrd uses Dijkstra's as shortest path (SP) algorithm, i.e., SPs are calculated from scratch for all known destinations upon incoming routing information that changes topology sets. Bounded Incremental Computation (BIC) shortest path algorithms aims at saving computation running time by bounding its complexity to the number of routers that were affected by topology changes. This proposal aims at implementing and performing comprehensive evaluation of a BIC shortest path algorithm for the olsrd.
