Emacs modes usually lack sophisticated IDE functions such as type checking, type inspection and method completion. Since the introduction of the Scala Presentation Compiler, it is now possible for an IDE to interact directly with the Scala compiler, leveraging the core type checking and type inference support. The ENSIME project aims to expose the Presentation Compiler to Emacs in a client/server architecture similar to SLIME, in order to provide advanced Scala IDE functionality to Emacs users.
