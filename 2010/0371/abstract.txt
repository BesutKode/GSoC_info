For an image handling library the support for a wide array of formats is key. While OpenImageIO already has an impressive spectrum of available plug-ins, it still lacks the support for several popular formats. This project aims to fill the gaps in the list of supported formats, starting out with finishing the already half-baked DDS, then moving on to Adobe DNG or any other format that is deemed high-priority by the mentor; possibly extending to cover more as time permits.
