Use of optimized computer vision algorithm is vital  to meet real-time requirements especially on popular mobile platform like BeagleBoard. OpenCV is one of the widely used computer vision library today. When designing application based on OpenCV on platform like BeagleBoard, it is desired that it could give real time performance. One way to achive this is by using on-chip DSP to accelerate OpenCV algorithms. This could also eventually boost the use of open-embedded platform like BeagleBoard.
