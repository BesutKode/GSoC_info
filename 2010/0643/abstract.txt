Apache PhotArk is an open source photo gallery application. This proposal suggests the implementation of a search functionality, exposed as a SCA component, for Apache PhotArk. The search component would be responsible for indexing text information extracted from a photo object and enable it for search. A tagging functionality is also suggested, where the user could attach any text to a photo or album, increasing the amount of text information related to it and more information to search for.
