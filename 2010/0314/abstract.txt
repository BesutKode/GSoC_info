I will refactor the RTEMS scheduler into a modular, isolated subsystem and demonstrate the new modularity by providing an earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduling mechanism to complement the existing fixed priority scheduling.  This project will refactor scheduling data structures and code into an interface so that multiple schedulers can be implemented, which will facilitate SMP scheduling.
