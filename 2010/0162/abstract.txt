This plug-in can be used by scientists, researchers and students to quickly find out which biological processes (pathways) are related to each other with respect to gene products /
metabolites / continuity and to what extent. Help them find out the common properties between
various processes. They can also find out pathways of their field of interest by starting from one pathway and gradually exploring the pathways mapped to that!
