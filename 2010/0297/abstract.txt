The goal of this project is to design and implement asynchronous operation for Apache Tuscany's Web support. Tuscany/SCA already has an asynchronous programming API which enables easily creating asynchronous services, and the very latest JEE Servlet spec also now supports asynchronous programming, so the idea is to use the new Servlet APIs to allow web browser clients to asynchronously receive the results of SCA callbacks.
