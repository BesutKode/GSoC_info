In this project I will create new colour choosers for the drawing application Krita and the vector drawing tool Karbon, which is part of KOffice. 
Currently these two programs use the same colour chooser as KOffice, which doesn't provide the functionality an artist would expect. Both programs would benefit from a colour space aware chooser with extended features.
