The current WordPress Idea Forum is a useful and necessary way for the project to receive feedback and accept feature requests from the WordPress user-base. However, there are certain features that could be improved and refined to make the forum even more effective. Just as P2 impacted Automattic positively by allowing instant collaboration on posts and topics, I believe a new specialized "ideas" theme would foster user-base collaboration on ideas in the Idea Forum.
