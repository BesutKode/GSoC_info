Design a fully featured PCM I/O API for Phonon, and provide an implementation for the Phonon-VLC backend and one other (either MPlayer or Xine). This API will allow developers to capture PCM data from devices like a sound card, or to play back raw audio from memory, or elsewhere. This will provide some important
missing features in Phonon, and open the door for many applications waiting to make use of an API like this.
