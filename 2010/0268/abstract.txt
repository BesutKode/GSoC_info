The following project has two major goals -- the primary goal is moving tpserver-cpp network layer into the Boost.ASIO framework, and preparing the rest of the server for taking advantage of the Proactor architecture that is weaved into ASIO. The secondary goal is to take advantage of the new architecture to rewrite the tpserver-cpp systems to be asynchronous, basing on ASIO's framework.
