The shipping daemon will deliver the audit trails generated through the network to a master system, that will admin the trails to have the auditing centralized, ease to admin and practical. The admin will have all the trails in one system and can do the security auditing in one system (perhaps a special system to keep the auditing). Some mechanisms as MD5 checksum and cryptographic features will be implemented to guarantee the integrity of the delivery system.
