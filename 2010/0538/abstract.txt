Web services allow scientists to reuse existing applications to save time in creating scientific workflows. The process of selecting a web service to use can be a time consuming and difficult one. There is room for improvement by providing web services with annotations, or information about the service and its performance. Annotations could be added and analyzed by an automated program, which could also make recommendations for scientists on which services to use for their scientific workflows.
