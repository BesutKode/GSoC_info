RegaDB, a specialist application that performs the genotypic prediction algorithms and presents the data RegaDB.The aim of this project is to integrate OpenMRS with RegaDB such that patient and diagnostic data may be managed in OpenMRS or RegaDB and interchanged between the two applications. In the former use case, genotyping data along with mutation patterns and clinical predictions are exported and stored in OpenMRS and presented to the clinical user.
