I propose the addition of a plugin for the Crystal Space engine that will provide the tools necessary for a user to render a scene using deferred shading. Accompanying the plugin will be a demo application and a full set of documentation. The demo application will highlight the unique benefits deferred shading allows with respect to dynamic lighting. The documentation will provide a low-level and a high-level discussion of the benefits and tradeoffs inherent with deferred shading.
