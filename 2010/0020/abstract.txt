The project aims to port Dracut to Gentoo. As a first part it will involve fixing test suites and updating modules to work in Gentoo. As a side-effect would be make the Dracut more generic and to ease to port it to other distros. Any changes from there need to go upstream. Second part is Gentoo specific. It will involve creating new (or modifying existing) ebuild for Dracut, integrate it with Genkernel and customize Catalyst (LiveCD generator) to use it.
