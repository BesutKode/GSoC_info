The Bullet Physics Engine (bulletphysics.org) is rapidly gaining popularity for use in high-end 3D-production software, studios, and game productions. Currently Blenderâ€™s Bullet support is limited baking Game Engine simulation runs, with limited interaction with standard animation features. This project aims to bring innovative and natural setup methods for Bullet simulations in Blender, well integrated into the animation system.
