This project is about improving the reliability of the XMPP stream between Psi and XMPP servers and user interface improvements.
Implementing XEP-0198 and XEP-0184 will hopefully improve reliability and redesigning the MUC user interfaces will highly improve
overall user experience and make it easier for users who are new to instant messaging to chat with other people.
