The Content Management Interoperability Services (CMIS) standard defines a domain model and Web Services and Restful AtomPub bindings that can be used by applications to work with one or more Content Management repositories/systems. I would develop a useful subset of this specification to add or increase interoperability among Plone and other CMS. This would be an application that runs in a server that implements the WSGI specifications and communicates with Plone servers via the wsapi4plone API
