I am going to implement a Scilab database module, representing two-layered architecture.

The feature will be available to user as a set of Scilab functions for connecting/disconnecting to/from database, managing transactions and executing queries against a database.

To make more use of database interfaces, I will also provide the ability to construct fuzzy queries to databases.
