Although, the patch contribution process is very important to OSS projects, it has many issues. The aim of this project is to develop a tool, PatchMetrix, to collects data in order to gain better understanding of the OSS patch contribution process capability, and improve the process. PatchMetrix will includes patch statistics and visualization. The information provided by PatchMetrix will help identify key process problems, and guide the community in making improvements.
