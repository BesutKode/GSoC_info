The aim of this project is to design fully-featured 3D/4D visualization tool for GRASS GIS and to replace current old-fashioned TCL/TK Nviz. This project continues in Google Summer Of Code project from 2008 ("2.5/3D visualization tool for wxPython GRASS GUI"). The main goal of the project is implement (1) all missing features from wxNviz's predecessor TCL/TK-based Nviz; (2) new functionality including e.g. fog visualization; and finally (3) text displaying and styling in OGSF library.
