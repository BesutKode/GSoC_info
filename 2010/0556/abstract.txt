One of the planned features for Review Board 2.0 is to include a third-party extension framework.  It actually appears that much of the work to create the framework has already been completed - but it has no documentation, and has not yet been integrated into the trunk branch.  I would like to finish off a version of the extension framework, document it, test it, and build an example extension that gathers basic user statistics.
