During this year's GSoC I intend to implement a new HI honeynet data capture tool, HV-Sebek (hardware virtualization assisted Sebek). This tool will have all the capability Sebek does now but will be much more stealthy and better tamper-resistance. This tool will be based on MAVMM and target at monitoring Linux based honeypots. The deliverables include the GPL licensed source code for this functionality, and a working demonstration system running in my lab at Peking University.
