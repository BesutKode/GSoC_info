Goals for this project is to port relevant SMB/MS-RPC related exploit and dos modules, as well as some useful enumeration modules, from the Metasploit tool to NMAP in a form of NSE scripts. NMAPs "smb-check-vulns.nse" already implements a check for a ms08-067 vulnerability, so this serves as a good motivational reference. Further more, the secondary goal would be to develop an MS-RPC fuzzer to the point of discovering new vulnerabilities.
