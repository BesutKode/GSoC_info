Linux offers a lot of great backup tools that are used with great satisfaction by enterprise and server market but it has neglected ordinary home users that do not wish to become skilled computer administrators to make sure their documents are safe for far too long. Deja Dup began to change that quite successfully but still has a long way to go to offer great experience to its users not just when they stumble upon it but rather from day one from Ubuntu's installation.
