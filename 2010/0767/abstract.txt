Drizzle is a dbms for cloud where scalability is the major concern. Memcached is a caching server between the database and the client which was designed to alleviate the dbms load by caching recently read results from dbms. Inbuilt caching feature is desirable to make Drizzle scalable while helping app developers write less code. The aim of the project is to write a replication plugin which replicates from Drizzle to Memcached maintaining integrity of the dbms while achieving better performance.
