The goal of my project is to develop automated tools to assist with security reviews of Drupal module code. The tools will be built atop the grammar parser library and its code manipulation API (CMAPI). The project may also involve extending and enhancing the CMAPI to support the security review tools. The code manipulation API provides tools for traversing, searching and modifying a code snippet. This foundation should prove useful to the development of a security review engine.
