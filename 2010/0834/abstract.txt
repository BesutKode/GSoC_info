Currently, package authors must devise ad-hoc solutions to automatically build and run test suites for their software.  I propose to improve Cabal's test support by extending the package description file to include information about tests.  Cabal will use this information to configure, build and run tests are automatically, making tests more widely used in the Haskell community and improving the quality of software written in Haskell.
