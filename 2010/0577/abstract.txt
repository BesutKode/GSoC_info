As has been discussed in the mailing-list thread "Some new ideas for this year's GSoC", in this proposal I suggest to implement some string searching algorithms (such as Rabin-Karp, KMP, BM, suffix arrays etc.) as well as document them with benchmarks so the user knows which one to choose for which purpose. The current find_first(), find_last() etc. functions will also be optimized to use the new implementations. Additionally, I am willing to extend the bindings to Python of BGL.
