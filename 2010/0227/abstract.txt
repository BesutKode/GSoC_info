Hugin's current fast preview window shows only a preview of the output. The downsides of this is that it's unintuitive for beginners and it constricts every feature to be dependent on the preview of the output. The purpose of this project is to use OpenGL's power for modelling 3D scenes and interactively visualize the intermediate steps of creating a panorama that is the panosphere and the plane in normal and mosaic modes respectively.
