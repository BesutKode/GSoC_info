BoostBook is a part of Boost project and provides mechanism for documentation of C++ libraries. DocBook is a semantic markup language for technical documentation. DocBook v5.0 is based on the REgular LAnguage for XML Next Generation (RLEAX NG) format. There is a need to merge the BoostBook with DocBook v5.0 in order to extend the existing functionality of DocBook to document APIs. The successful integration will enable the DocBook to provide vocabulary for both technical and API documentations.
