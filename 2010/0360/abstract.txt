The goal of this project is to do a full system profile of Globus GridFTP server including CPU and memory profiling. From the system profiling information, I will learn to understand the tradeoff between single client performance and server load and the impact of several parameters on data transfer rate and server CPU utilization. I will identify such configurations that improve the client performance without increasing server load and enable users to configure and optimize their systems.
