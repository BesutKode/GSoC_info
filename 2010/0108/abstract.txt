My proposal is to get Tiano Core working as a payload in coreboot.  Tiano Core is the open-source part of Intel's implementation of an Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI).  From chatting on IRC, I can see there is a great deal of interest in the coreboot community in getting Tiano Core running properly as a payload, as this would allow coreboot users to gain all the advantages of having EFI.
