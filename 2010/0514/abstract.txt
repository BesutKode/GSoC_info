Currently, only some aspects of OpenMRS support localization. These are:
(1)The Concept Dictionary - localized concept names
(2)Pre-defined pages that can draw from message resource bundles

This project will support the localization of metadata which can be defined at runtime by end-user, e.g., EncounterType.name
