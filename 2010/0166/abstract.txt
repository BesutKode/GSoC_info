This project will add NEON SIMD co-processor support for FFTW on the BeagleBoard with particular interest in improved support for GNU Radio and GNU Octave. FFTW is widely used in the open source community and this project would make FFTW far more useful on processors with NEON instructions (e.g. OMAP3, i.MX). An additional task, specific to OMAP3, is to leverage the C64x+ DSP for double-precision floating-point support for FFTW.
