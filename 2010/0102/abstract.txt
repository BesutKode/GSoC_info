A project to build a GUI application (written in C++ with QT) that will allow users to graphically edit Rockbox themes.  The application will allow for simple management of theme settings and resources, and verification, display, and editing of WPS files.  WPS files will be editable in a syntax-highlighted text editor or on a graphical canvas with instant preview, while other settings can be managed through dialog boxes and menus.
