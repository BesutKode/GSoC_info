Mind maps are used to generate, visualize, structure, and classify ideas, and as an aid in brainstorms, study, organization, problem solving, decision making, and writing.

Today the most usable mind mapping software is XMind. But it is written in Java, has non-kde UI and can't be integrated with kde. The idea is to bring mind mapping elements to Koffice and XMind-like functionality to Braindump.
