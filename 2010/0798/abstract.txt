Pardus Live CD currently doesn't have an installation option.Most of the new distros come with Installation option embedded with Live CD. The purpose of this project is to create such a Live CD that can also install Pardus on a hard drive on demand. Modifications on YALI and Pardusman are required mostly. It can greatly benefit to the users of Pardus by saving their Internet bandwidth and effort to download a separate installation CD each time when a new version of Pardus is released.
