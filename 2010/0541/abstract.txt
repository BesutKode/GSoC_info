Non-destructive editing should provide a way to alter images without actually touching the original by storing all the changes in image's metadata. This data then should be read when the image is opened and all the stored changes should be applied back to the image and the output must give the same altered result. User can also make several different versions of image modifications (applying different filters with different values etc.) and he should have access to all the versions he created.
