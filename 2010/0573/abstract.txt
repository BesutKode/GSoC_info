I love python, he give me the liberty to think about how to implement the solution and not in the code him self . My style of coding is to write beautiful code and understandable one,  and with python it's much simple. For the open source community it's been my dream to be part of it since i began my career in computer science , and i hope that the GSOC will give me the opportunity to be part of the community , i'm  willing to do my best to accomplish my mission .
