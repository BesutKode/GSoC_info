The idea is to make enhancement to pgAdmin,which would provide the user with an intuitive graphical comparer and a synchronizing feature. The user could know difference between two selected database(objects), and would enable user to visualize the comparison before applying the  difference on the source/target db's. This feature would enhance the developer/dba ability to not only apply all changes with few clicks, but to be sure what would happen to the data base(schema) in question.
