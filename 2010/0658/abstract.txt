OGSA-DAI is a middleware bundle for high scale data integration across the network, enabling collaboration by sharing data resources - accessing, transforming, integrating, and delivering them. Its presentation layer is SOAP based and is derived from the outdated Axis 1.4 stack. Benchmarks have shown that CXF outperforms Axis and Axis2 in binary data transfer. Hence a web service presentation layer based on CXF along with an alternative RESTful presentation layer using CXF JAX-RS is preferred.
