The goal is to implement the POSIX Asynchronous IO and List IO as defined by the OpenGroup. Currently RTEMS supports only synchronous IO which means that when an IO request is made the thread enters a wait state until the operation completes. A different approach is to overlap the processes with the IO, that is after issuing the request the calling thread continues to process another job until it is notified that the IO operation finished, then it continues to process the data.
