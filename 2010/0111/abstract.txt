I'm proposing a puppet module that can manage network interfaces for unix and linux systems. The module would be able to change ip addresses, change between static and dynamic, and should be able to manage anything in /etc/sysconfig/network. System Administers would be confident knowing their network configurations are being managed by puppet, ensuring consistency across all systems and saving valuable time.
