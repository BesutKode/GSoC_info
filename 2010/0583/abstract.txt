I intend to build an advanced theme editing and revisioning system. The main focus would be to develop revisioning and snapshots for theme files (and themes themselves). In some respects, the project is a bundled series of improvements of the existing theme editor, which the project aims to replace in core. Revisions would be stored as a custom post type and would be backed by a diff engine. Additional goals are to identify and implement a replacement for CodePress and sandbox functions.php.
