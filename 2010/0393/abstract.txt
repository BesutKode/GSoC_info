I would like to make a set of tools that will help Gentoo Council and Gentoo Recruiters Team to work more effectively. I will prepare a website for Council which will do the work that is now done manually and an IRC bot that will allow to use meeting log on website. The Councils website will also allow more input from developers community. The Recruiters website will help recruiters to prepare better quizzes and mark them in more accurately.
