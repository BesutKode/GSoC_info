The goal of this Project is to develop a software system for use in OpenWrt
based firmwares which makes hardware which telephony and networking hardware easily accessible.
It will involve designing and implementing a Linux kernel framework which provides a common
API to such hardware devices.
Then the next step then is to develop userspace tools making use of that API
for call management.

The hardware which will be used for this Project as an example platform will be the AirTies WAV-281.
