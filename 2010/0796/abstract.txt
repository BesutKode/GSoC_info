The productivity of artists working on high quality photorealistic renders of 3D scenes, especially 3D animations, is limited by the long time to wait for the image to be computed. Microrendering is a novel approach to the final gathering phase of several physically based rendering algorithms that by making use of the massively parallel nature of modern GPUs is able to improve the rendering speed to real time rates.
