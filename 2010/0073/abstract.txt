There are currently a few problems with Django's app loading implementation. Most notably, it's not possible to install apps with the same module name and there is no way of specifying configuration options on the app level. The proposed solution will add Application objects to Django, which will hold models and options. To change the models or options, the developer can subclass the Application class.
