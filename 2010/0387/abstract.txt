My name is Jason Hays.  I'm a Junior at Eastern Kentucky University and I'm majoring in computer science.  I'm very interested in the graphing calculator project, and have no other commitments this summer.
I currently have a GPA of 4.0, and this is the only application I've submitted anywhere this summer.
