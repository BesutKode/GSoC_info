Currently x264 is constrained to encoding videos with a sample depth of 8 bits. This often suffices for consumer needs, but for production purposes and high quality video encoding, it may not be sufficient.

The primary goal for this project is to prepare the code base for encoding H.264 video with user defined sample depths.
