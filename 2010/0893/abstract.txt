The open source community relies on a vast array of mirrors to host downloads. While this works well, the current state makes it very difficult to gain information about downloads. The goal of this project is to design and implement a client/server system that records and reports download information to a central server. The server is then responsible for processing the information and generating statistics about project downloads for use by project administrators.
