How the identifying regions of a particular object are described has a huge impact on the task of successful object recognition.  Region Covariance Features have been proposed as an improved region descriptor to current approaches, possessing an invariance to rotation and illumination changes.  This project will involve implementing Region Covariance Descriptors in the OpenCV library, enabling a previously specified object to be re-identified in provided images, with reliable accuracy.
