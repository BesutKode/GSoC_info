ThinkTank project will benefit from display of response generating places on dynamically created maps. TT plugins will collect data about places and reverse geo-code it to locate the nearest city. Locations, in different color schemes for different characteristics, will be shown on a Google map. Controls, along maps and general filter, will enable users to focus on particular response categories. My Geo-location Visualization project will implement these features in a simple and neat interface.
