There are currently 3 pendent projects in Umit (ZION, NSE Facilitator e Preferences Window), so my objective for Google Summer of Code is to integrate all that 3 projects for the mainstream version of Umit. With the new projects the Preferences Window need to be refactored to support the new options. Because Umit will need to support 2 backends, it implies refactoring the umit.core (NmapParser, etc). With the Zion integration, Umit will be more scalable, and allow more efficient network searchs.
