Blender  2.50 is much more powerful now than any previous version of blender. And the exporter for YafaRay can give YafaRay users the way to use their favorite renderer right inside the Blender interface. YafaRay has some options that are different from Blender. So the export system will take those extra parameters from the user  in a user friendly fashion and can also use the parameters that are common to both Blender and YafaRay. After feeding these data to YafaRay,It can do it's magic.
