Recent mobile devices show that it is sometimes not sensible to replace the
entire factory operating system with Rockbox on them, for example if
they have features Rockbox does not offer currently.
As many devices come with the ability to run third party application, we want
to be able to extent them with Rockbox' most stunning features by running
as an application.
The goal of this project is to lay the groundwork for running Rockbox as an
application and to port it to a device.
