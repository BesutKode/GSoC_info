qemu has many commands attached to the monitor interface that are
currently inaccessible over QMP (QEMU Machine Protocol).
I intend to give continuity to this effort, converting the
remaining functions to the QObject API. While doing this conversion,
the QObject API can be updated to improve its functionality when
required.
