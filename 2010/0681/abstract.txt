I would like to work on an enhancement of the current WordPress comment moderation tools. In particular, I would like to add a way to re-assign a comment to a different parent thread. For some reason, many commentators ignore the threading and leave their message as a root-level comment. It would be very handy to have a way for users with sufficient privileges to move a comment into a different thread. Also, I think the Admin could use better threaded comment support.
