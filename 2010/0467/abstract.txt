mandoc -Tps is missing.  While mandoc is fast becoming byte-compatible with GNU troff for terminal output (-Tascii) and has advanced X/HTML output (-Thtml, -Txhtml), there does not yet exist PostScript output (-Tps).  I propose implementing -Tps, initially as a shim over terminal output, then, with this milestone complete, bringing in more typographic awareness (variable-font, justification, etc.).
