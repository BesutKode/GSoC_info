The goal of this proposal is to set up a framework for graph streaming. A Graph Streaming API would bring a lot of advantages to Gephi, bringing interoperability with other available tools. A high-quality API proposal should be general and, as the Gephi's data structure and visualization engine does, it should be able to deal with dynamic data, with the idea that a graph is not static and might change continuously.
