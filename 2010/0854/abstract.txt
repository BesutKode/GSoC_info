The main aim of this project will be to provide a high level interface for the Pulse Width Modulation output pins of the OMAP3 found on the BeagleBoard.
Another aim will be to push this driver upstream(the Linux-OMAP tree).
Two applications will be developed to demonstrate the use of this driver:
1) Motor control using PWM signals generated by the BeagleBoard using the PWM driver.
2) Writing a glue layer for ALSA to communicate with the PWM driver and output sound from the PWM output pins.
