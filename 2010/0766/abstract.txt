GDAL and GRASS form the foundation for many GIS projects. Thus, improvements in imagery reprojecting/resampling will cascade to dependent projects. Quality resampling is a slow operation. GDAL has more advanced resampling algorithms than GRASS. I propose to fix both these problems using OpenCL on a graphics card and calculate hundreds of pixels simultaneously. I will synchronize the OpenCL code between GRASS and GDAL, expanding the algorithms available in GRASS.
