The purpose of the MPWA is to streamline the process of interacting with the MacPorts database. By creating a web app it will allow users to easily search and access information about the ports they use. The application will serve as an aggregator of information about the database as a whole an the ports which make it up. It will provide a simpler and more central location for users that would otherwise have to go to the various repositories of information that make up the MacPorts project.
