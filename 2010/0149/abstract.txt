The proposal focuses special attention on further development of dynamic network analysis (DNA) in Gephi. It has got a very practical purpose, in particular nowadays: analyzing evolution of networks [1][2] and dynamic network visualization [3]. The aim is to handle dynamic changes not only of graph topology but also attributes connected with nodes and edges. The end-product would be a framework which would make possible to build and query a dynamic graph with use of a proper API.
