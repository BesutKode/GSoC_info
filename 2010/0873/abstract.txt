A service comprise of several components/tiers known as clustered service. Clustered services could be hosted as a group of interconnected virtual machines in a cloud with specific deployment requirements. Currently, OpenNebula does not offer a service management component allowing users to deploy and manage their clustered applications. The exact contribution of this project is to develop a component for OpenNebula that will allow users to control the life-cycle of clustered services easily.
