The TorDNSEL project is concerned with identifying individual hosts
  as valid and accessible Tor exit relays.  Each Tor exit relay has an
  associated exit policy governing what traffic may leave the Tor
  circuit and go out as requests to the internet.  A public database
  that can be easily queried or scraped would be of huge benefit to
  the Tor community and to services that are interested in whether
  clients originate from the Tor network, such as Wikipedia and IRC
  networks.
