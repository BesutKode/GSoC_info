OpenMRS is an open-source, enterprise electronic medical record system platform which is widely used for managing health systems in the developing countries. One of the major requirement for a person working with this system is to view patient data in reverse chronological order. This feature will allow the users to get an overall idea about a patient at a glance. This project for implementing Longitudinal Data Review Module intends to present patient data in  different views for easy review.
