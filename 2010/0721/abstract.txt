Copy, close source, paste fails in Ubuntu for more apps than not. It's a long standing problem that affects every Ubuntu user, and one that deserves a fix.

I hope to:

Create a webpage detailing how to fix the bug
Fix this bug in >8 Ubuntu apps
Implement a less piecemeal change with mentor help
 Change GTK+ to store clipboard contents on exit by default
 Ready parcellite for inclusion with Ubuntu
 Modify gnome-settings-daemon to store clipboard contents before they're requested
