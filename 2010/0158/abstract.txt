HipHop for PHP is a compiler developed by Facebook that turns PHP into highly optimised C++ code. It serves 90% traffic of Facebook and have helped reducing CPU usage by averagely fifty percent [1]. The source code of HipHop for PHP was released on February 2010. However, it needs several improvements such 32-bit support, integration of more PHP modules and a better build mechanism. The goal of this GSoC project is to solve these problems to make it a better tool for the Open Source community.
