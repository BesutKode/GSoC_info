Git is a great distributed revision control system and, thanks to EGit and JGit developers, Eclipse has quite high quality support for Git right now. The goal of this project is to improve EGit functionality by integrating it with "Synchronize view" (which is one of the best features in Eclipse CVS plugin). The second part of the project would be adding 'git stash' support for JGit and UI for it into EGit. Implementing both these features would make Git support in Eclipse closer to 'CVS quality'
