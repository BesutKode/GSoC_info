The aim is to achieve higher consolidation ratios (more VMs per host) for KVM platform using memory compression at the host level. While servers with 64 or more cores are becoming common in future, the prices of DRAM remain prohibitive. Considering these trends, memory compression appears to be an effective way of utilizing memory resource which is often the main bottleneck for Virtualization workloads.
