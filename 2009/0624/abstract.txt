This proposal aims at providing debug binary packages for the packages in
the Debian archive in an automatic manner, moving them away from the official
Debian archive to an special one.

This has the benefits of providing thousands of debug packages without any
work needed from the developers, for all the architectures, without bloating
the archive.
