Tie in validation that is currently only happening in Form objects and allow for models to define their own validation logic. The idea is to define validation logic for your models along with their definition and have it propagated into their respective ModelForms. Part of this project should also be refactor of the current validation logic in Forms and abstract it so that there is no duplicity in code (models vs forms)
