Project 4: Developing a solution for managing client honeypots.

I am well suited to perform this project because of my interest in web development and IT security (especially honeypots).
I left my country to work on honeypots for one year in the United States, in a specialized laboratory at the university of Maryland, and I am really enjoying it. So I would be very interested in working on this project.
I have a lot of time to invest into, and plenty of ideas.
