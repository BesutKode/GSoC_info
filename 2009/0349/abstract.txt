Many service providers using a REST based API to offer developers access to their services, i.e. Twitter, Facebook and so on. The result of this is that some third parties provide Java based libraries, which covers this API's. The ECF team played a little bit with the Twitter API and use therefore a library called Twitter4J. 
The disadvantage of this technique is a dependency to the third parties library. This means an ECF container based on such a library is dependent on the diversity of this. To decouple these dependencies an own ECF based REST abstraction should be created within this GSoC project.
