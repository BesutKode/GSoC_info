SeaBIOS is the way to to boot all kinds of different operating systems.It support both PATA and SATA disk to boot various operating systems. It is also a coreboot payload that implements 16bit BIOS interrupts as they are needed by nearly all boot loaders today. One major feature that we're desperately lacking is USB stick/disk/cdrom booting from SeaBIOS. The main job may be add USB support for SeaBIOS which should be implemented as a PCI option rom.
