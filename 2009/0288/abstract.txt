AbiWord is well known as one of the most useful open source word processing programs. It supports many word processing tasks to satisfy users’ needs. AbiWord is very powerful since it can easily be extended with plugins. For instance, OpenXML plugin has been very useful to many users since it allows importing and exporting Microsoft Office Word 2007 documents. However, there is still a significant amount of work to be done to improve AbiWord’s OpenXML support. In this application, I propose to improve OpenXML plugin to support a wide range of documents which can be imported and exported without any data loss.
