On the Internet are several sources of weather information. This includes current weather and weather forecasts. This project will be about adding a plugin to Marble that fetches weather information from the internet and displays it on the Marble globe. This will look like weather forecasts in tv news, but the user can select any possible map section himself. Making the plugin configurable will require several changes to Marble's plugin system.
