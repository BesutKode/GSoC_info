I will refactor the Catalyst's helpers for extensability. They are underdeveloped compared to other parts of Catalyst. Current solutions are brittle, and inconsistent. I will provide a new API, with tests and documentation. The new API will provide standard methods to initialize and write files, modify existing code, and provide the user with a starting point. This will be a valuable addition, updating the mostly unmaintained codebase and ensuring that helper scripts have improved functionality.
