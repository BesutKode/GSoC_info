GNU Guile includes a new VM and compiler infrastructure
for performance improvements in the current development tree.  Additionally,
it is designed in such a way as to allow easy extension with new languages.

I would like to implement support for Emacs Lisp on top of this
framework to allow Guile to run elisp code in addition to the Scheme
language it is based on originally; this will allow Guile to be used for
an even broader context and work with a large base of existing scripts.
