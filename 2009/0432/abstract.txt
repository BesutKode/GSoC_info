I am Kashyap R Puranik from Bangalore, India, studying Computer-science in IITM (Indian Institute of Technology Madras, India)

I am proposing to add the molecular calculator widget for Kalzium, which can do all the common calculations that a chemistry student would like to do.

I have already been contributing to Kalzium for the past 4 months.
I have added a few small features (details in my blog)
