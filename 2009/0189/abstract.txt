The Recommender Bundle provides a set of modules that generate recommendations and personalized views in a wide range of areas. For example, "Customers who bought this also bought" for Ubercart, Facebook-like new friends suggestions for social network sites, Youtube-like related videos for media sites, or the classical example of generating personalized node recommendations based on users access history, and much more.
