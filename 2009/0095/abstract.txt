Graph partitioning is an important problem with extensive application in scientific computing, optimization, VLSI design, and task partitioning for parallel processing. 
My GSoC project would be to implement several graph partitioning algorithms on the existing BGL graph types, and then, depending on the availability of a hypergraph data structure, either look at partitioning algorithms on hypergraphs, or attempt to implement those partitioning algorithms in The Parallel BGL.
