This proposal is about bringing "Big" decimal arithmetic to Parrot in the form of three PMCs wrapping IBM's libdecnumber. The BigInt and BigNum PMCs are intended as replacements to the current GMP-based PMCs of the same name, while the BigRat PMC will add support for the new Big Rationals specified in PDD14_Numbers. The proposal also covers the import into parrot's testing harness decNumber's extensive test suite.
