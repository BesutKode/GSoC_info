Formerly used primarily in PDAs and cellphones, ARM is starting to target netbooks and laptops with its new Cortex-A series of processors. One key feature of these new processors is the NEON SIMD unit, the use of which will massively boost the performance of many multimedia applications. This project will consist of writing NEON/ARMv6 SIMD assembly for all of the major DSP functions in x264, ideally speeding x264 up by over 4-5 times.
