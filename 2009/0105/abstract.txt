This Project is aimed to create a Firefox extension that can record sound locally and stream to Icecast. In this project I will make the extension platform free.For this extension I will use nsILocalFile interface which will enable the extension to interact with the operating system. I will use operating system's sound recorder to record the sound and then for Windows I have to convert the recorded sound into Ogg vorbis format and then user cam stream it to Icecast.
