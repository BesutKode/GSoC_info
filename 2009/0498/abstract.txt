Mancala is a family of board games played around the world. The name, board and the object of the game may vary considerably to regions. These games have vast historical importance. Implementing these will give a chance to reserve cultural diversity and promote child education. I want to implement these games under the  common type name Mancala.The interface   will be interactive which changes according to the region. My attempt will be to make the player not only play but also feel Mancala.
