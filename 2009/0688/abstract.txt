This project is aimed at creating a language / framework independent Gesture Recognition toolkit that takes OSC messages formatted with TUIO specification as input and outputs recognized gestures via OSC protocol. I will use the gesture recognition toolkit AMELiA to describe models specifically for the domain of multitouch gestures. This project will enable multitouch application developers to easily define a gesture and utilize it within their application, creating more engaging experiences.
