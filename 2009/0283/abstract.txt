This project aims at introducing a framework for pluggable disk
schedulers in GEOM, available to the user as a GEOM class, with
scheduling algorithms implemented in external modules.

We have already implemented a prototype for the framework and we
already have some example schedulers.  The ultimate goals of this
project will be to produce a stable scheduling framework and
at least a general purpose disk scheduling plugin, suitable for
use under desktop workloads.
