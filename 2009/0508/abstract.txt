This is a proposal to develop an extension to the pkgdb to make it more useful to the general fedora user or potential user rather than the package developer which it now targets. Other *nix distributions already have this in different forms (ex: http://packages.debian.org). Features include: versions, dependencies, hdd space requirements, license, upstream url, spec file url, file list, commit messages, user comments, tagging, RSS feeds, etc.
