The management console for Qpidâ€™s Java messaging broker lacks usability, making it in many ways no better and often worse than a generic JMX tool like JConsole. Additionally, the implementation is hard to maintain. My aim is to create a new user interface for the console that is more attuned to the operations being undertaken, and more maintainable. In order to do so, some work will be required to refactor the existing console to better separate some of the core functionality from the interface.
