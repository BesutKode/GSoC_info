My objective is to enable a common NetBSD user to configure and execute a bulk install of NetBSD on any number of networked machines using PXE booting. The user will be able to create custom defined machine configurations for application to different machines.

The PXE Bulk Install system has already been created, but is in a rough, virtually undocumented state. My work will involve simplifying the process of configuration as well as writing extensive documentation.
