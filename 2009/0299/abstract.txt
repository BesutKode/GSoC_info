The goal of this project is to implement the Graphviz DOT language as a domain-specific language (DSL) for Zest (The Eclipse Visualization Toolkit), both as an input and output format. In other words, the goal is to transform both DOT graphs to Zest visualizations (to be used in Java SWT applications), and Zest visualizations to DOT graphs (to be rendered as image files with Graphviz).
