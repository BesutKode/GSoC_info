My project is based on the idea of a Google Gears Integration to Moodle (see forum http://moodle.org/mod/forum/discuss.php?d=118015). This mode will allow people with limited Internet connection to browse activities and other resources in Moodle, take notes and store them locally, save assignments and then upload/synchronize when the user is online. Moreover, the plan is to create a working base/architecture and then make it easier to add any kind of activity to the Gears module.
