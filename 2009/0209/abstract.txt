I will be making several changes to Drupal's Version Control System (VCS) integration to make it a viable replacement for the current CVS-only system used. The ultimate goal would be to develop alternate backends such as Subversion and Git to the point that they could be used in lieu of CVS for managing the Drupal core and the contributed modules. Additionally, I will implement web-based support for creating branches of projects, similar to <a href="https://code.launchpad.net/bzr">Launchpad</a>.
