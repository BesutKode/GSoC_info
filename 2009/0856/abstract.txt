Last year, another GSoC'er worked on a project that allows developers to rapidly craft individual packets with a very fine level of detail.  The framework will be extended to allow the testing of various TCP/IP stack states and corner cases.  This will effectively result in the re-implementation of TCP stack fragments in user-space, and testing the test fragments against the actual TCP stack. The resulting suite will be used to prevent regression errors in the TCP\IP stack.
