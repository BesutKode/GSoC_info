Digital photography has been advancing rapidly in terms of hardware.
All introductory priced DSLR camera models now support more than 8bits(up to 14bits)
per color channel in raw mode (HDR images). Since LCD/CRT displays support 8bit
per channel only, this extra color depth information cannot be presented to the
user with current technology. The solution is to compress (tonemap) the image
in color space so as to produce an LDR image, suitable for display.
