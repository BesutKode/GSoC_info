Currently, administration of the ServiceMix Kernel OSGi container can be done through an text-based console. While this is a very powerful tool, we would also like to build a web-based management console to administer the platform. One key requirement for this console is that it allows for easy extension by features being installed on top of Kernel, e.g. ServiceMix 4 installs an NMR and JBI layer on top of Kernel, both of which should be administrable seamlessly through the web UI
