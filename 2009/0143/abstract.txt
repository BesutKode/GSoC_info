CiviCRM installations exist in over thirty languages using various alphabets. Multi-language support, developed during GSoC 2008, enabled non-profits and NGOs working in multilingual countries (like Canada or India) and cross-border areas to use CiviCRM in multiple languages (and multiple alphabets) at the same time. This proposal extends the multilingual features as well as introduces new solutions helping translators to better and easier localize CiviCRM, as well as collaborate with others.
