Constructive Solid Geometry(CSG) is a procedural modeling technique that represents solids as Boolean combinations of more primitive solids. Boundary Representation (B-REP) represents solids by their limits. Both of these systems have their own merits. My project will bring these two systems together by implementing methods for evaluating Boolean operations on B-REP. The algorithm to be implemented hinges upon calculating the intersection curves between Bezier patches.
