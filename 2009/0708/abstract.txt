Including Java as a mandatory component in the LSB (similar to the support of Perl and Python) has been difficult due to some non-technical issues. I recognize the importance of Java and would like to provide a pathway for Java application to become LSB certified. Therefore, the creation of an LSB certifiable JRE is very important to community and a number of Java application providers. My aim in this project is to patch source code and building scripts of OpenJDK for it to become LSB compliant.
