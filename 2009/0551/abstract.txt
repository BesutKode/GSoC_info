The goal of this project is to provide two additional viewers into Zest project: Space Tree and Tree Map. Space Tree is a powerful form of visualization for large sets of tree-structured data, that concentrates on dynamic rescaling and hiding of branches. Tree Map is a well known visualization method using nested rectangles, which areas correspond to some aspects of presented data. This project will implement this idea in a traditional form but also try to experiment on it.
