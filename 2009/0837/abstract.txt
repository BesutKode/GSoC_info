CS currently has a partial implementation of Imposters and no easy-to-use LOD solution for Genmeshes.

The first goal is to finish this implementation and provide a system for the management of imposters (dynamic creation, updating and removal).

The second goal is to implement a progressive LOD solution (runtime or precalculated) for Genmeshes.
