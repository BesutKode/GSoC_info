The project goal for the proposal “Managing Applications across Clouds” is to extend the interoperability of the SAGA framework by adding support for the “Sector and Sphere” computing model in order for applications to be able to exploit the Open Cloud consortium test bed. This requires coding a new adapter for SAGA that allows the SAGA API to be able to submit jobs to Sector and Sphere cloud computing platform, perform filesystem calls etc.
