The current MusicBrainz database is starting to become too restrictive, and a new database schema - NGS - has been designed to help solve current problems. While this new schema evolution has been talked about within the community, no real effort has yet begun on implementing the system. I propose to provide work on NGS by revamping the edit system of MusicBrainz to support the new editing possibilities NGS will bring, and also provide support work to aid developers working on NGS.
