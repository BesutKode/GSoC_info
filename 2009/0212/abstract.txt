Phylogenetic trees are used in important applications, including phylogenomics, phylogeography, gene function prediction, cladistics and the study of molecular evolution. In order to foster successful analysis, exchange, storage and reuse of phylogenetic trees and associated data, the phyloXML format was developed. It can store all necessary information about the phylogenetic tree, like clade, sequence, name and distance. The goal of this project is to implement support for phyloXML in BioRuby.
