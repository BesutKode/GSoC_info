PhyloWS is an emerging standard for interacting with phylogenetic data via web services. Phylr, is an initial implementation of the SRU search in PhyloWS. The goals of this project are to enhance the Java code that translates between the SRU server and a Lucene index and make it fully conform to the PhyloWS specs, modify the XSL stylesheets to present a more intuitive interface to the users, and write a new Java adapter that translates between the SRU server and a relational database.
