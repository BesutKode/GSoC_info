I'm a big fan of TikiWiki and I think that a phpBB and MediaWiki importer to Tiki might be a good feature to incentive more people to join the community. My plan is to create an importer interface with native support to phpBB and MediaWiki. The importer should be as generic as possible, so it will be easier to develop support for other softwares in the future. If I'm able to finish the project before the deadline I'm interested in developing the importers from other wiki based softwares to Tiki.
