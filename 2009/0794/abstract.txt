Norwegian has two written variants, Bokmål and Nynorsk. The Apertium
translation pair for Bokmål-Nynorsk has many available resources
(morphological dictionaries, CG tagger) but work is needed to make it
a full-blown translation system. This involves expanding the
dictionaries with closed class words and adjectives, making transfer
rules for the structurally different noun phrases and improving
coverage of the translation dictionaries.
