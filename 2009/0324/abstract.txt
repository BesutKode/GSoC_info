Currently, calling a Fortran routine from Cython is difficult and error-prone
if one desires: 1) speed, 2) portable wrapping, 3) seamless passing of
numpy array objects, and 4) Fortran 90 code that uses assumed-shape arrays.

Our project will address the above shortcomings by improving f2py-Cython
integration. There are 2 aspects to the project: enhancing f2py to generate
updated Fortran wrappers callable from C, and enhancing Cython to enable
passing python buffers to external code.
