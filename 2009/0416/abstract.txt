I will be using a BigTable to create persistent storage for AtomTable. This will first require linking to the BigTable to implement a simple save/load API for Atom Handles. I will then use that implementation to provide just-in-time data persistence for AtomTable. That is, AtomTable will be modified to, in conjunction with the ECAN system, maintain in memory only those atoms which are currently most important. This will relegate the AtomTable into an AtomCache of the larger, persistent BigTable.
