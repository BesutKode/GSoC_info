The Regexp engine of the tcl language should be improved in following ways:
* Improve performance and/or memory usage.
* Implement regexp reversion.
* Fixed character width is assumed, this should be changed.
* Rewrite the code to use tcl's coding style.
* Implement stream interface. 
* Implement lookbehind constraints.
