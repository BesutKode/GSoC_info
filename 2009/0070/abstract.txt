This proposal is to work on the new project under consideration at
CSCS@UMichigan, Developing Libraries for GPGPU Agent-Based Models. I
wish to begin developing a library of GPGPU tools based on a
reimplementation of the ABM in "Neighbourhood Choice and Neighbourhood
Change" (originally implemented in REPAST in Java) by Dr. Elizabeth
Bruch. I am flexible on the exact ABM chosen, but envision developing
the model in either CUDA or PyCUDA, as OpenCL is not yet an available
alternative.
