This project would build a Xen VM that has a minimal runtime environment necessary to run OSGi applications, making smaller systems feasible in the cloud and datacenter, ultimately enabling more instances to be running in a data center, or less consumption of metered resources in a cloud.  The project would build an environment to run OSGi applications on "bare metal". That is, OSGi applications running on the Xen VM, with the a minimal OS/JVM; reducing the overhead of the system 5-10 fold.
