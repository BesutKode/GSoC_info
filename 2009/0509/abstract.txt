This project is divided into two tasks. First, the aim is the implementation of software metrics, such as lines of code, code coverage and other metrics, to provide support for analysis of existent R packages. The second task is the creation of a CRAN software metrics monitor. That is, a service that continuously calculates software metrics over CRAN packages and provides the resulting (raw) data.
