Iterative feedback-directed compilation combined with statistical and machine learning techniques showed very promising results in automating optimization heuristic tuning and compiler design for rapidly evolving hardware to considerably improve program performance and code size. Iâ€™d like to extend GCC to be able to select/deselect individual optimizations on a fine-grain level and tune their parameters automatically using machine learning technology from the MILEPOST project.
