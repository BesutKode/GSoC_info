The goal of this project is to check DragonFly's code against the C99/POSIX (1003.1-2001) standards and make sure that the system adheres to them as much as possible. In the places it doesn't, existing code will be modified or missing bits added, and the whole process be meticulously documented. Eventually, user experience is bound to be improved and the need of maintaining specific patches in the pkgsrc tree alleviated, lowering the burden for the pkgsrc developers.
