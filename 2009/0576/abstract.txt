The inotify extension relies on Linux file system event notification features to provide a fast access to the directory state: registering the watched directories with inotify, it is able to keep track of the repository status without walking the repository itself. This extension greatly improves performance on large repositories.

It is however still experimental, and lacks support for windows and Mac OS.

My project is to improve inotify extension reliability, and to port it to Mac Os.
