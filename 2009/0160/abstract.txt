This project aims to develop a client-server communication for Symbol definitions' exchange. For that, gvsig symbology module for style editing will be extended. On the server side, a social-network application will interact with the user to upload symbologies. Then, the client will ask for them based on their tags. The code could also be used by other projects completely, by only changing the GUI module.
