OpenCog has recently been given the capability to control birtual dogs and humanoids in the RealXTend and Multiverse virtual worlds. OpenCog-control agents can learn new behaviors via imitation and reinforcement. OpenCog also has a language comprehension system (RelEx) associated with it. The project I propose is to integrate these components so that the OpenCog-controlled virtual agents can comprehend simple language pertaining to their environment.
