Pulse collects data and presents them in a useful manner. It was written with the needs of the documentation team in mind but I belief it could be useful to all GNOME's contributes. IMHO integrating bug trackers with pulse would help this goal most. So this project's goal is to integrate bugs.gnome.org and work together with contributers how to do this best and what to do beyond it.
