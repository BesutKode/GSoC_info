The following is a proposal for one college student to have an awesome summer producing useful code for a useful open source project called SIP Communicator! I would like to contribute a sort of "Display User Chat Agent" extension for SIP Communicator. The overall goals of the project would be to produce light, simple, maintainable code that easily "plugs in" to the current SIP Communicator.
