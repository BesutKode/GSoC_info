This project is proposing to create a set of performance tools for use with GEGL. They will be designed to help developers find where the time is spent, and at these hotspots, what the processor is doing. The use of the performance tools has to be as simple and straight forward as possible. These tools will be designed to be used in a non-interactive batch manner and to produce html output meant to be used both in automatic performance-regression testing and perf tuning during development.
