Highly accurate synchronization of PC and server clocks is crucial for many applications. Microprocessor based NTP servers suffer from a large amount of timestamp jitter (e.g., ~50000 ns), for a variety of reasons such as OS scheduling and unpredictable bus timing. The goal of this project is to implement a stratum-1 NTP server in reconfigurable logic, capable of gigabit Ethernet linerates with less than 8 ns of jitter, and a flexible stratum-0 interface.
