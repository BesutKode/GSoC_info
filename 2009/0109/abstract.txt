JDT already provides several very good refactorings like Extract method. Despite the fact they are behave very good there are still some unresolved bugs and open enhancement requests. The project will take the "Extract method" refactoring to the next step by resolving all (possible) bugs and trying to enhance the current functionality. As it is one of the most used refactorings in day-to-day development it really deserves some work to get all details and edge cases fixed.
