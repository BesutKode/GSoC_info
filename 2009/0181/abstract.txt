This project aims to improve on my haskell-src-exts library for working with Haskell source code. The goal of the project is to have haskell-src-exts supercede the haskell-src library. The main thing involved is to add a mechanism that allows the user to conditionally choose what extensions the parser should be aware of. Further, I would extend haskell-src(-exts) with functionality to handle comments and exact layout, to allow for things like automatic code generation and refactoring.
