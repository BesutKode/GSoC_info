I am proposing to work on the Syndication API for AptitudeCMS (Aka Geeklog V2).


Reading and Writing of arbitrary feeds based on content on the site, and importing content from other sites, is a simple way to syndicate content for others to use and add their content to your own site.

I see this as an important part of Week-long/AptitudeCMS, as users of a site based on the CMS, would obviously like to read News on the subject, of the content within the CMS.
