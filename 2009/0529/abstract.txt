OpenBioMind is an open-source port of BioMind, a software package for applying AI techniques to large databases of biological data. It is already a powerful tool for geneticists. However, it need not be limited to analyzing genetic datasets. Neurobiologists are also generating large datasets, available in databases such as the Allen Brain Atlas, GENSAT Project, Mouse Brain Library, and BrainMap. I propose to extend OpenBioMind to analyze these neurobiological data.
