The Nimbus software does not have the capability to schedule requests across multiple clusters providing cloud resources, as highlighted in Globus project idea "ClusterBuilder: Distributed Virtual Environments over the Clouds". The summer project involves 2 parts. Part 1 will create a tool to publish information about the Nimbus cloud resources at a particular site to a registry (likely Globus MDS). Part 2  will be the creation of a tool to schedule requests to multiple Nimbus clouds.
