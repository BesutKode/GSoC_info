C++ is not a popular language for programming in .net framework. There are some cases when it can't be replaced with other language (ex. C#). Embedding unmanaged classes source within a managed application can be done only using managed c++. Thats why lack of c++ support in SharpDevelop seems to be a problem. That makes some users to stop using SharpDevelop and switch to other IDEs. The aim of the project is to add c++/cli support in SharpDevelop.
