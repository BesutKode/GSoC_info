GridSweeper is a tool for automating parameter sweeps of computational models on grid systems such as the Sun Grid Engine. Developed from the beginning as a Summer of Code project, it has been used by researchers and students at the University of Michigan Center for the Study of Complex Systems to aid in the study of a wide variety of complex systems.

This year, I propose to work on two major tasks:
(1) Complete a 1.0 release of GridSweeper that can be deployed easily by other grid administrators.
(2) Work on improvements for future releases, focusing on finishing the adaptive parameter sampling work begun during Summer of Code 2008.
