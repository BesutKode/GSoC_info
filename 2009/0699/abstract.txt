The goal of this project will be giving VideoLAN access to a great number of online music and video services, like Jamendo, last.fm, Magnatune, musicovery (maybe, there doesn't seem to be an API available), and whatever will comes to mind...
This will be done writing new services discovery modules for it; the coding will be done mainly in C and lua, for the modules, and i believe a little bit of C++ will be required for integrating everything in the interface...
