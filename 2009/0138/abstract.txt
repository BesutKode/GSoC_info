To implement fast water simulation in Step I will use FLUIDS, a GPL Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics Library. Using this algorithm, I will be able to represent a large number of particles in a Fluid and potentially Gas simulation, allowing the extraction of interesting macroscopic properties of our fluid. Fluids will be represented graphically using an overlapping circles and allow real-time adjusting quantities like density and pressure for each fluid particle.
