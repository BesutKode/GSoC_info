A project to improve Haddock, the Haskell documentation tool, both substantively in the short term and to be better factored in the long term.  I will resolve many Haddock Trac tickets; specific projects are to make cross-package documentation work, and to refactor the comment-parsing out of GHC and into the Haddock code-base.
