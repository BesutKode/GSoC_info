SymPy, a computer algebra system written and used in python, currently has all but no support for ordinary differential equation solving.  My proposal is to expand the solution engine to include all common types of ordinary differential equations, including all the common symbolic methods, some approximation methods such as series and numerical solution techniques, and some systems of ordinary differential equations solution techniques.
