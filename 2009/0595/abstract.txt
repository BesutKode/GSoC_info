The idea is to integrate in a single application GeoReport and Spatialytics in PentahoBI platform
using CDF extenstion in order to setting and creating GeoDashboards as easy as possible both
for spatially navigating (multidimentional) cubes and for displaying charts, diagrams, indicators
directly from the map click, depending on user needs!
