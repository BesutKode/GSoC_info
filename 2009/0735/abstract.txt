I would like to create a complete filtering architecture for the Akonadi KDE Personal Information Management system.

Filtering, in this context, stands for “applying conditional changes to the attributes of the data items coming into the akonadi server”. E-mail messages that come from a specific sender may be moved to a special folder. Other messages with a subject matching a particular regular expression might be treated as spam: beside moving them to a special folder one might want to add a “spam” tag and possibly mark them automatically as “read”.

In the Akonadi architecture these operations will be performed by a filter agent process. The agent will apply a sequence of filtering rules defined in a configuration file. The configuration file, in turn, will be edited by applications by using the GUI facilities provided by a shared library.

The project will focus on filtering of e-mail messages but one of the goals will be to provide a framework that is generic enough to allow easy development of filtering agents for different kinds of personal information data items.
