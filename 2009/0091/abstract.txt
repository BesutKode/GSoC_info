In this project I will implement an open-source C++ library to compute phylogenetic tree likelihoods on the GPU, with the core loops in OpenCL. Currently in phylogenetic inference there is a strong demand for more computational speed and typically likelihood calculation is the main bottleneck. Moving to GPU acceleration is a natural step to address that issue and this project has the potential to benefit several state-of-the-art evolutionary analysis packages.
