The objective of this work is to augment the TraceMonkey just-in-time
compiler with a puzzle based register allocator specially tuned for
just-in-time compilation.

We expect that our new allocator will produce better native code than the
current register allocator used by TraceMonkey, without compromising its
compilation speed.
