EclipseFP is a plugin for the Java IDE Eclipse that adds support for Haskell. However, it is not yet perfect, and contains many bugs and UI quirks. I will bring this plugin to a more usable state, starting with some bugfixes and small improvements. The next step is to make Eclipse communicate with the GHC API through the scion library, so that more advanced features such as type inference become possible. I will also add support for the de-facto standard package manager Cabal.
