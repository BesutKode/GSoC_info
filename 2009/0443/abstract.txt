Since joining Moca (remote medical diagnostics platform developed at MIT) as a research student, I have been able to work closely with Dr. Gari Clifford, Clark Freifeld, Zack Anderson, and RJ Ryan on the technical development of Moca (Android phones and OpenMRS). I have become familiar with the vision and codebase of OpenMRS and believe that there are tremendous implications and possibilities for this system. Hence, I am eager to contribute my skills to one of your projects this summer.
