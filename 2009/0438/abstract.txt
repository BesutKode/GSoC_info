This project consists of implementing a new refactoring system for the KDE developer platform, using a high-level abstract representation of code known as “Du-Chain.” This project will provide a structured, abstract framework of refactoring concepts, which will enable future developments such as Language dependent plug-ins, code analysis, and code generation  to be possible. A language specific Abstract Syntax Tree for C++ will be implemented as well.
