The goal is to make some AviSynth video filters available as GStreamer pipeline elements. This would also bring AviSynth v3.0 vapor-ware closer to reality.
The project consists of:
1) Implementing frame number information extraction in demuxers
2) Implementing frame-based seeking
3) Implementing a video ringbuffer
4) Implementing GstAVSynth wrapper library
5) Implementing GstAVSynth headers/libraries for AviSynth filters to build against
