This proposal try to improve the picviz, changing some features and adding new features for it. It addresses some possible improvements in a graphical tool for creating PCP (parallel coordinate plot). Graphics of this type are generally confusing to understand, there are some techniques in studies of PCPs can be applied to optimize the recognition of information in the graphics.Some these techniques will be used in order to turn more easy and efficient analysis of log data using picviz.
