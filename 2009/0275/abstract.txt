We propose development of a library that provides Python programmers with processor level SIMD instructions and consequently the possibility of writing high performance programs in Python. This module will be architecture independent and so users will not need to know details required for assembly programming. An important part of this module is a register allocation component. This module will be built on top of CorePy, a module that allows programmers to write assembly within Python.
