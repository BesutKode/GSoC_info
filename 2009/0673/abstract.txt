The OGSA-DAI DQP product, currently in development, is a distributed query processor based on the OGSA-DAI technology. It is going to extend the functionality of the existing OGSA-DQP system and aims to provide a flexible framework for data integration and research in distributed query processing.

Implementation of methods that would allow monitoring of query execution and adaptive cost estimation is the focus of this project.
