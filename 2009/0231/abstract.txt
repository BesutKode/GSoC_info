I would create a free, open-source application that would allow anyone with a projector, webcam, and a computer to seamlessly integrate graphs, pictures, or any other image into lecture notes written on a chalkboard. This would be most applicable to the teaching of multivariable mathematics, where 3D graphs often help students grasp the concepts involve, but the difficulty of drawing said graphs limits their use in lectures.
