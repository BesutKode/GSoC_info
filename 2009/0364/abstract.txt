This project is about creating a code kickstarter for new plugins, developed on the grounds of the Extbase, the MVC and persistence framework for new TYPO3v4 extensions. It will work similar to the old TYPO3 extension kickstarter in the way that it will still be possible to use a graphical web-based user interface to specifiy the properties of the extension to be generated and then have it be written directly to the extension directory, but go beyond those functionalities in a number of ways.
