AbiWord currently uses GTK+'s table layout algorithm, which works well for small tables. For larger tables, it is quite slow as it uses a quadratic algorithm. In this project I propose to investigate the table layout algorithms in Firefox and OpenOffice and implement a suitable one in AbiWord. This should speed up table performance considerably, as those applications are able to handle really large tables with high speed.
