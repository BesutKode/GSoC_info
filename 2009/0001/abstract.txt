Current versions of Native Client solve some security issues like modules verification and creation of secure execution environments. In this project attempts to solve secure modules distribution problems (in terms of modules authentication and integrity) will be performed by introducing so-called "Trusted Native Client Module". The core idea can be related to Java signed applets and similar technologies which are using public key infrastructure to ensure that signed code is trusted.
