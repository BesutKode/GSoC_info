Audacity is currently focused on the next stable release, so bug-fixing and tools to aid release are priorities. I intend to fix a selection of the problems from the release checklist; to work towards completing the 'Find Notes' feature by improving the related code; and to further develop the currently experimental scripting support. These enhancements should help the project move faster towards the next release and beyond.
