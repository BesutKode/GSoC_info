ZFS is general purpose file system designed and written by Sun for Solaris operating 
system. It was designed with support for high storage devices in mind. It is a 128bit file 
systems and therefore it support Zetabyte partition size. This filesystem was released 
under the CDDL license and his code is freely available. 

My task during soc would be continue in effort of Andrew Doran and Oliver Gould and 
eventualy get ZFS into the working state in NetBSD.
