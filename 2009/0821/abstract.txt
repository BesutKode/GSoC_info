Libchamplain is a C library providing a ClutterActor to display maps. It is my goal to add support for local map rendering of OpenStreetMap XML data. This is going to allow the client to use custom map themes, to choose different projections and to do the selection or exclusion of map elements. Libchamplain will become useful for a wider range of applications. A local renderer also provides the foundation to support accessibility features for maps.
