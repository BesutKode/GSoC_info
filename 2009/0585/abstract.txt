The tp04 protocol, nearing completion, is the next version of Thousand Parsec's server-client network protocol, and it brings with it new features such as dynamic objects and order queues, media attached to objects, and dynamic server and metaserver protocols. However, tpclient-pywx cannot currently take full advantage of these new features, and it is unable to properly work with the new protocol. TP04 support will bring tpclient-pywx in line with the newest developments in Thousand Parsec and keep it relevant and useful. It will also show off the new tp04 features and improve the polish of the interface.
