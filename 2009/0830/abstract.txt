Users spend significant amount of time reading the documentation. Providing some ways of interaction on this background is in the best interest of the user and wider community. 

Instead of adding a simple commenting framework to Sphinx, I will create a platform of discussion as well as documentation enhancement.

The benefits of this addition would be: better reviewed, more up to date, extended documentation, tighter community ties and eased procedures of submitting the documentation fixes.
