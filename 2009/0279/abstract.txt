In my project I plan to implement the statistical classification and regression tree algorithm GUIDE [1] based on the existing partykit infrastructure on R-Forge. GUIDE has negligible bias in split variable selection and is sensitive to curvature and local pairwise interactions between regressor variables, only to mention a few advantages. Since GUIDE is not implemented in R yet, my project aims to make it available to the R community.
