The goal of this project is to improve the Font support on pgreloaded, the Python 3000 branch of PyGame. The project attempts to redesign the interface of the pgreloaded Font module, making it more pythonic, higher level and extending its core with more complex text-drawing functionality and support for other font formats, such as BDF. Additionally, all the key features of the project which don't break API/ABI compatibility will be backported into the original PyGame.
