Fiji is an Image Processing tool with great potential for further development to improve usability and thus boost task efficiency. This project will implement a new plugin manager for convenient installation and tracking of Java plugins which serve as add-on utilities. The Plugin Manager will be able to manage the list of plugins that are visible on the menu, effectively taking charge of enabling and disabling of these plugins, and the updating/installation of these utilities.
