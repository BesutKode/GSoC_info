I propose to build a facility to produce a boot image for a system with no more than 4MB Flash / 16MB RAM, run a useful NetBSD router with DHCP client/server, IPv6 route solicitation/advertisement, PPPoE, and an 802.11a/b/g WPA access point. The image will be replicable: using only the NetBSD sources, and my scripts and Makefiles, a developer should be able to cross-build their system boot image.
