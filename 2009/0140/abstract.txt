BPEL is an executable language used in web service compositions and Apache ODE is a work flow engine capable of executing BPEL processes.BPELUnit is an open source testing framework used to unit test BPEL processes.Currently BPELUnit has not been integrated with ODE to provide deployment support or measuring unit test coverage. The aim of this project is, therefore, extending the BPELUnit framework for enabling it to package and deploy instrumented process models to ODE.
