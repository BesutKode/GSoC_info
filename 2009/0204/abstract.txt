phpMyAdmin can export databases into far more formats than it can import. First, I will extend the import framework to allow for multiple table creation, column type and title detection, as well as other functions conducive to making the framework powerful and generalized enough to handle a wide array of formats. I will then create parser modules for several formats which will utilize these additions. These changes would substantially enhance the convenience of phpMyAdmin for a great many users.
