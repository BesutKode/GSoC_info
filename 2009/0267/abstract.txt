For a platform such as Scilab, providing a fast and reliable implementation of ANN is of high priority. Users should be able to build and activate a network in just a few commands. Several implementations of ANN exist in various programming languages. The solution is to interface Scilab with one of those existing implementations. This project proposal exposes the details of a solution based upon the SNNS library, and discusses the evolution of such an ANN toolbox.
