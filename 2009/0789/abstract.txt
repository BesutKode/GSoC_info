Comparing documents for changes is an essential feature in text editing software. Currently, Writerâ€™s comparison function performs poorly (worse than the algorithms below). The goal of this project is to significantly improve it by using several algorithms: an LCS based one, a Levenshtein distance one, and an algorithm that takes into account moving portions of the text. An evaluative algorithm will choose the best output. The user will be able to choose the method and set its parameters.
