If a NetBSD system using a software RAID device loses power
or crashes, a lengthy (many hours, for today's disk sizes) and
I/O-intensive parity rewrite is required afterwards.  I propose to
modify the raid(4) driver to remove this deficiency — which may be
discouraging the use of NetBSD in server applications — by more
closely tracking which parity information actually needs to be
recomputed.  In addition, some less major shortcomings of raid(4)
could be addressed at the same time.
