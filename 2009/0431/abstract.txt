Network measurement is essential task for any network.
Networks size and speed is growing. Packet-based solutions doesn't
fit well into modern network, as computational complexity keeps
getting higher. Most effective solutions are flow-based. Problem here 
is effective generating of flows at high-speed links. This problem is 
most essential for embeddable devices when we have limited CPU and 
memory resources. I propose new effective IPFIX probe for 
obtaining flows at high-speed links.
