Researches use Taverna workbench for creating workflows, which include calls to web services. In case of caGrid data services, the access to the data may be too complicated for the end-users, because of the need to use CQL language. In that case the plug-in will be a great help for biologists, allowing them to focus on their work rather than on correct query construction. Besides the basic functionality of constructing CQL queries, the plug-in will offer additional conveniences for the users.
