Basic media device support for iPods and MTP devices is present in Amarok 2, but the lack of feature parity with Amarok 1.4.x is stopping many people from partly or fully adopting Amarok 2.  Missing components for iPods/MTP include: playlist support, maintenance support (e.g. initializing iPod, see %free space), and full GUI interaction and feedback for every operation performed.  Universal Mass Storage (UMS) support is missing altogether, and UMS devices are the most commonly available media device.  The aim of this project is to reach feature parity with Amarok 1.4.x in terms of iPod, MTP, and UMS device support.
