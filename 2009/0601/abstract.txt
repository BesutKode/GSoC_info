In this project we want to enhance the capability of the existing TS muxer and write a new PS muxer. The enhancement of TS muxer would aim to ensure an output playable on mainstream players, while for the PS muxer the plan is to write a full featured PS muxing library, together with a plugin connecting the library to GStreamer. With these done, GStreamer would achieve better support on the MPEG-2 standard and usability.
