Active lists are an important clinical tool, allowing physicians to check existing conditions before a potential treatment to avoid undesirable side effects. To do this in OpenMRS, users currently have to scan through the observations manually, noting any allergies or diagnoses. The goal of this project would be to add specific support for these lists, exposing a service to manage them, and saving the time of both physicians and patients.
