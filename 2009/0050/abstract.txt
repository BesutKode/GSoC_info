Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) is the essential part of the IPv6 stack. The Secure Neighbor Discovery protocol (SeND) [rfc3971] counters threats to NDP. This project aims for the design of the efficient and portable SeND implementation. Its goal is to implement a new userspace-kernel API for SeND, which will mitigate overhead associated with netgraph and Berkley Packet Filter used in the existing FreeBSD SeND implementation.
