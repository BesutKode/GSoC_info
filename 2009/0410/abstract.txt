This project consist in a module that will let work with symbolic math on scilab.
There is a module that connect scilab with Maxima through an intermediary program but this way is very slow, a faster way is to create a dynamic library of Maxima with ECL, but a native tool is a better choice.
A lighter way is using GiNac library, the integration with scilab will be easier, and there is more programmers on C++ than Lisp, so more people would enhance the tool. This approach is the one I prefer.
