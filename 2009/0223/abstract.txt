The address bar in Camino is beginning to show its age. I propose to update it this summer with the following changes:
• Inline autocomplete
• Autocomplete from local bookmarks
• Tweak layout of autocomplete list (see screenshots)
• Implement a sorting algorithm for autocomplete results similar to Firefox's frecency algorithm
• Integrate with online bookmarking sites
• Tag search
