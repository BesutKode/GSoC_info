PtidyOS requires that the communications amount the nodes are by transmitting time-stamped  events with known bounded delays.  This project proposes the design and implementation of a network communication  scheme that guarantee such behavior. Initially two alternatives are considered: avoid the IP stack in order to build  a predictable access to  the network based on  FTT-Ethernet (or a simple TDMA scheme);  implement a middleware, like ORTE, able to management real-time constrains.
