Thanks to Google SoC 2007 hugin got ghost removal for merging to HDR images using khan algorithm. The goal of my work would be to add ghost removal technique to the enfuse tool. This would need some changes to the current implementation interface and altering current implementation to be able to mix the weights generated by enfuse properly with weights generated by khan.
As an optional goal I'd like to implement new ghost removal technique (see [2] in content).
