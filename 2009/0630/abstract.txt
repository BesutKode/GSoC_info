Two of the system calls provided by Plan 9 (mount and bind) are especially tricky to implement in Linux because they depend on each process maintaining it's own namespace. Though Linux has some rudimentary support for this (CLONE_NEWNS, only usable by root), your job will be to extend this support throughout the entire system, Plan 9 style. You will then use this support in order to correctly implement the mount and bind system calls.
