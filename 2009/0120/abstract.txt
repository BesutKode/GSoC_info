Wavpack is an audio codec which provides three modes of operation: a traditional lossy algorithm, a perfect-fidelity lossless mode, and an innovative hybrid mode.  Operating in hybrid mode, the encoder produces two files: a lossy Wavpack file which Rockbox may currently play on many devices, and a "correction" file which may be used by a decoder to reproduce the original bitstream.  I aim to implement support for the correction files in Rockbox.
