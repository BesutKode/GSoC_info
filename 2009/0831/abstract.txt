The goal of this project is to implement a minimal end-to-end loop-based auto-vectorization system for LLVM. Auto-vectorization is a well-researched topic with numerous dependencies on other analysis and transformation passes, so a significant part of the proposed project is to evaluate already-available LLVM passes regarding their applicability to support auto-vectorization and to add what's missing. Special emphasis will be given to loop-dependence analysis.
