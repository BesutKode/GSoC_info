Currently TuxMath and TuxType are standalone programs that are controlled only by the user. The idea is to give more control to the teacher, so that he/she could integrate Tux4Kids into the school curriculum. This includes an ability to set the same activity for all students, manage high scores etc. The project is to create a configuration/administration utility to achieve this goal.
