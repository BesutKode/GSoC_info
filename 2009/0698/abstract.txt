This project focuses on developing an event modeler in Ptolemy that would be a front-end for Esper. This work would build on already existing domains of Ptolemy such as discrete-event (DE) or event relationship graphs (ERG). The goal would be to develop the infrastructure that generates an Esper EQL program (i.e. EQL query) from a Ptolemy graphical model. The query can then be loaded and processed by Esper event engine. Moreover, the model could be simulated in Ptolemy given input event streams.
