To correct lens distortion, Hugin requires a user to generate control points on straight lines - a time consuming process - allowing the optimiser to calculate the correct calibration parameters. Hugin should aim to automate as many difficult parts of the work flow as is possible, and given that there are a variety of efficient line detection algorithms available, the lens calibration issue should be addressed. This will allow Hugin to produce better panoramas with less distortion.
