The major aim of this work is to provide a fault tolerant mechanism for systems based on Service Oriented Architecture, in especially for those developed using the Service Component Architecture. The fault tolerance will be provided using an exception handling mechanism. Such mechanisms, applied in a Service Component Architecture, will explore the scenario where many components, working concurrently, exchange asynchronous messages in order to compose an collaborative activity.
