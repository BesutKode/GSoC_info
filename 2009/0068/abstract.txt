The project aims to implement a canvas-based GUI modeller for energy systems, which enjoys significant advantages over a text-based modeller in terms of user friendliness. The current GUI modeller of ASCEND supports certain basic features, but lacks support for other essential features which are usually expected from a standard GUI modeller. I would be implementing all such vital features into the existing modeller making it more complete in terms of functionality and thus more appealing to use.
