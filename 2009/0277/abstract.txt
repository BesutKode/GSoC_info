Tables are common in many documents, and can be considered a key feature of a word processor. KWord currently lacks a competitive implementation of tables in its latest iteration, the upcoming 2.0 release. In this project, I will try to build a basic and robust implementation of editable tables, including loading and saving, that can later be extended to a more competitive implementation.
