This proposal aims at optimizing blender raytrace.

Including:
	* Making it faster
	* Support for render instancing
	* Added support for generic objects (used to implement instancing but later can be expanded into LOD)
	* Script to measure performance
	* Removing worst-cases
	* Make it easier to try tweaks and different data structures.
