Re-factoring is a significant focus of Drizzle at the moment. The developers have already identified 7 custom containers that can be replaced. My proposal is to take one, the various list implementations, and replace all occurrences with std::list or whichever container best suits the usage scenario. This alone was deemed to be a summers worth of work by the potential mentors. If the task is finished ahead of schedule, at least 6 other containers can be re-factored as well.
