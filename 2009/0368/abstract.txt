9load, the Plan 9 kernel loader, suffer from some problems: 
- Since the code is not the same, kernel and 9load evolve at a different
pace. For example, hardware configurations may be supported by the
kernel and not by 9load. 
- boot parameters must reside in plan9.ini. 

The new boot process will be done by the kernel itself. It will then run a
userland program which, in turn, will provide means of loading a configuration
file or a final kernel.
