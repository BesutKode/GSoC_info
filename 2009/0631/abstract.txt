As an operating system oriented towards users, it feels strange that
Haiku has no support for internationalization and is only available in
english. The goal of this project is to add a Locale Kit to the
system, allowing all the bundled applications, tools and preflets to
be translated to the correct language at runtime. The translation
should be made simple with the use of a graphical tool, and the user
should be able to select his language easily when installing the
system, then switch to another one at runtime.
