This project will improve the ApacheSolr module by enabling it to handle (i.e., index and search with a comfortable UI) any kind of RDF data. This will instantly make it possible to provide meaningful searches for all site content that isn't node-centric, as well as content from anywhere else on the web. Only an RDF class description and a way to access the data would have to be provided (apart from the normal Solr requirements) and the module would automatically do the rest of the work.
