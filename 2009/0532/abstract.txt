The Thousand Parsec team began building a multi-platform client which utilizes the KDE API to implement the graphical user interface and the C++ protocol library, libtpproto-cpp, to provide the game logic backbone. Currently, the Parsek client can only connect to servers, download objects, and primitively display messages. The goal of this project is to finish the Parsek client so it can be distributed with KDE Games allow users to play Thousand Parsec games.
