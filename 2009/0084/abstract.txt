MINIX 3 does not yet have a /proc file system that provides information about processes. In this project, I will implement a new file-system server that populates the /proc directory with per-process information. Second, MINIX 3 currently allocates all device nodes statically on the root device. I will implement a new /dev file-system server that provides an interface for the drivers to dynamically register their devices and modify the system to use it.
