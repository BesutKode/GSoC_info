I propose two things.  First, I would like to develop a suite of clustering algorithms for the MediaCloud project.  I am then interested in using this suite to work at resolving a particular problem: determining and comparing the topic clusters for particular media outlets. That is, determining what topics are of greatest interest to, say, Fox News, and how this set of topics differs from that of, say, Daily Kos.
