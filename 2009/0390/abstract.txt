Until now a proof-of-principle jobsystem was developed for ATLAS computing (LHC at CERN, Geneva) using Amazon Web Services. The idea is to make the system compatible to Nimbus. Then it would be possible to easily distribute jobs among different clouds. Additionally, the implementation of GANGA (delivering a standardized job description language) into the system would be convenient.
