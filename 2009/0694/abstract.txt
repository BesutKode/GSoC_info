Despite its growing size, Geeklog lacks a test framework to automatically run and debug the code. This is needed, as small changes can cause unanticipated bugs in existing code, and unknown bugs may exist in current code. My proposed project this summer is to select a test framework, adapt it to Geeklog, and create the structure that will run automated tests on Geeklog's class/function level. In addition, I will begin working through Geeklog's code, testing code and most likely uncovering bugs. By the summer's end, this framework will be available to developers to test their new code with and encompass a useful portion of the code base.
