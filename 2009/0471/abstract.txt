The task of this project is to generate natural English sentence(s) using RelEx [1] and the Link Parser [2]. Ideally, when we input the RelEx relationships produced by applying RelEx to a sentence, the NL generation system will generate one or more natural, well-formed sentence(s), which have the same meaning as the original sentence.
