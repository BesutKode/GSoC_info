The PyMW project attempts to bring the simplicity and beauty of Python to parallel and grid computing by providing a common interface for any parallel processing architecture. This proposal is to enhance the capabilities of the PyMW BOINC interface in three ways: 1) by simplifying project setup; 2) by adding support for custom validation, assimilation, and replication; and 3) by adding checkpointing systems for client and server.
