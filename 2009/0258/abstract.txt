Develop a complete bookmarks system replacement for Konqueror, using akonadi as the backend-frontend interface, and using Nepomuk as the backend in which those bookmarks are stored. I would also develop a new location bar similar to firefox awesomebar which lets the user type keywords and find related bookmarks, a krunner plugin similar to the current one to be able to find bookmarks using krunner, and a bookmarks editor which exposes all the new posibilities to the user in a friendly way.
