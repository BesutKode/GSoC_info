Vote Up/Down is a popular and widely used module for most of Drupal's voting requirements. The initial design and goal of Vote Up/Down has changed from being a "Digg.com clone tool" to being faster, modular and more generic voting module. This proposal aims to make it the rockstar of all voting modules by accomplishing some very important pending tasks and feature requests, like  widget API, Views integration etc.
