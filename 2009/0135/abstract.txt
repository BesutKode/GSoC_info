There are a couple of Samba front-ends that facilitate the remote administration of a Windows NT Workstation. These include a Task Scheduler manager, a Security Accounts Manager (for dealing with users and groups), a remote Windows Registry editor and a front-end to the Endpoint Mapper. The goal is to rewrite these tools in python, to implement the missing functionalities and to integrate them with the Gnome desktop environment.
