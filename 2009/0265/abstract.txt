PYGR is a python based Graph Database Framework developed for bioinformatic applications. Currently, the only external alignment program that has a proper interface with PYGR is blastall. Since, there are a host of other external alignment programs, it will be highly beneficial to have an interface for these external programs.In this project, I plan to implement the required interfaces to the following external programs: blat, clustal, lagan and m-lagan, and blastz.
