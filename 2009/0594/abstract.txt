Demos and SDK samples are one of the best ways to attract new users to the OGRE community and help them get started. The current samples framework, while solid, is outdated and lacks extensibility and versatility. I would like to develop a unified samples framework to replace the existing ExampleApplication framework, in addition to a sample browser. Among other features, the framework will support switching between multiple samples in one session, and dynamically detecting/loading samples. Having a unified, extensible and pluggable samples framework and a browser would not only make samples look more professional and spiffy; it would also allow us to create and modify samples and demos more quickly and efficiently.
