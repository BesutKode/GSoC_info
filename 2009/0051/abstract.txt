Goal of this project is to port Vx32 and 9vx to windows. Vx32 is a user-mode facility to execute untrusted x86 securely and efficiently by sandboxing and eventually executing it natively on the host processor. 9vx emulates a Plan 9 kernel and allows effective and secure execution of a Plan 9 environment purely in user space. Porting this system to windows links a major leap in the 9vx system to be able to integrate it into heterogeneous computing environments we have today.
