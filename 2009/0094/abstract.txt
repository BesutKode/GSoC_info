There are currently two Creative Commons (CC) modules for Drupal. CC Lite only offers limited functionality, but the CC module has not been updated for a long time and doesn't support current versions of Drupal. I plan to: (1) update the Creative Commons module, referencing and possibly building on Creative Commons lite, to support Drupal 6; and (2) expand its functionality to embed and detect license information for some file uploads.
