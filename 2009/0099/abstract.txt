wxWidgets aims to provide developers with a good solution to build cross-platform applications. This includes GUI libraries and a set of companion wrapper libraries for networking, multi threading and more. File system notification support I intend to implement will enable new exciting opportunities for developers using wxWidgets: creating cross-platform indexing solutions, interactive file managers, reloading configuration files in apps, advanced backup and synchronizing software and lots more.
