OpenJPA is a feature rich implementation of the Java Persistence API. Slice is a distributed persistence module for OpenJPA to enable any OpenJPA module to work seamlessly across horizontally partitioned databases. Presently, there are some restrictions on the query, like the related tuples must be in the same partition. In this project we aim to design a strategy to overcome these constraint so that we can "join" the relations even when the related records are not in the same partition.
