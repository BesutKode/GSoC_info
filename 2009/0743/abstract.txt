Apache Axis2 has become a very popular framework for implementing web services using Java. 
Axis2 recently made the move to Java 1.5 from 1.4, to obtain the benefits of the newer JDK. However, it does not yet support a very useful feature introduced in Java 1.5, namely Generics, the desirability of which is made apparent by requests and feedback from the Axis2 community. The project I am proposing will be aimed towards implementing Java Generics support for the Axis2 Web services framework.
