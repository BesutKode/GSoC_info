The current version of the script is used to run more than 8000 tests which takes an unacceptably long time. The main goal of this project is to convert the existing code in a in modern object-orientated structure. A multi-process-architecture makes it possible to run the test-cases parallel instead of passing them through sequentially which will improve the performance	considerably. Another focus is to offer a rich variant of reporting-features and the possibility to store and compare results.
