FreeBSD supports only whole filesystem encryption at device level (with
GELI or GBDE), but lacks in kernel cryptographic filesystem that can be
used transparently atop of other filesystem. Some progress has been seen
here recently with userlevel cryptographic filesystems, but userlevel
implementations are slow and relay and 3rd party software not included
in base system (namely fuse kmod and library). I propose to implement in
kernel cryptographic filesystem utilizing stackable VFS layers (like
nullfs+crypto).
