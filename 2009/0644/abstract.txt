The application is a Keyboard accessible Directions tool using OpenSteetMap for Visually Impaired people (as well as general mass), such that maps can be used by all. It works on the principle such that,after user enters source and destination as his/her query in text boxes, the route or walking/driving directions are resulted as output not only on maps but also as detailed text explaining entire route(confirming to W3C guidelines),such that it is easily readable.
