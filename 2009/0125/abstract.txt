The Fifty State Project is a project Sunlight Labs is running to collect legislative from all 50 states plus DC.  Over the course of the summer I would like work to finish all of the state parsers are complete and in good shape.  Next I want to create a robust backend that updates itself so I can finish the summer of by building an API for developers who want to build applications on those data.
