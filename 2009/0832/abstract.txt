This proposal is to work on adding the "Change Tracking" functionality for PHPMyAdmin.The functionality would help the developer of the phpMyAdmin to migrate changes from one place to another by just pressing the synchronization button.The changes being done in a table could be adding/removing/ updating tuples,creating/dropping tables, changing schema and maintaining table evolution from state A to B.
