The TP server tpserver-cpp isn't in bad shape. However, there are 
many places for improvement, especially if allowed to use the full 
power of the Boost libraries. This project aims at a serious review
of tpserver-cpp doing both high-level refactoring as well as fixing or
addressing the smaller issues.
