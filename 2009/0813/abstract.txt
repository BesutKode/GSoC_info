SWIG's directors allow "callback" functionality to be wrapped.
Essentially this enables a user to inherit a target language class from
a C++ class enabling cross language polymorphism. SWIG currently only
supports directors for Python, Ruby, Java, C#, and Ocaml. In particular,
PHP support is lacking, but it's certainly possible to implement - and
this summer I would like to work on this.
