One of the aspects that can help making KDE even more competitve over the desktop scene is, for sure, the way it manages multimedia contents. An easy to use and, at the same time, beautiful set of tools designed to help the user manage his own media contents would represent for sure one step forward in order to meet a wider range of user needs. This goal can be achieved developing Plasma Media Center Components.
