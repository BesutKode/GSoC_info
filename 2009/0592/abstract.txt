I propose the modernization of the CrystalSpace shading system to employ a more sophisticated reflection model.  Different industry standard models will be explored including, but not limited to, Cook-Torrance, Oren-Nayer, pre-filtered environment or reflection mapping, and numerical methods (like spherical harmonic or wavelet basis fittings).  Both real-time and precomputed versions of these reflection models will be developed and incorporated in the current CrystalSpace lighting system.
