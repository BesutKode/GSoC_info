The goal of this project is to migrate the GDB graphical interface in
Emacs to completely use GDB's Machine Interface (GDB/MI).

Currently a mixture of GDB annotations and GDB/MI are used to provide
GDB UI in Emacs. Dropping deprecated annotations in favor of
machine-oriented GDB/MI protocol will make underlying codebase more
robust and easier to maintain and improve. Switching to GDB/MI will
also allow using new features of GDB from Emacs.
