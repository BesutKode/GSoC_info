LProf was at one point using Qt3 . It has recently been ported to Qt4 from Qt3. But at this time it is still using the Qt3 compatibility libraries.
Basically what is needed is to  replace the calls to these compatibility libraries with native Qt4 code.
Mostly,I have to find the location of the Qt3 code and then finding what the replacement Qt4 calls would look like.Then I have to modify and test the code.
