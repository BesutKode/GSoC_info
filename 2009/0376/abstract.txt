The goals of my project are twofold:

1. I want to complete my work on Procedure Pointers, which includes (a) some bug fixing as well as additional features, like (b) procedure pointer return values and (c) procedure pointer components. 

2. I would like to continue working on outstanding Fortran 2003 OOP features. gfortran already has a basic level of support for OOP, but many things like the CLASS statement and polymorphism are still missing.
