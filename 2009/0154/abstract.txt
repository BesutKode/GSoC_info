This project opens up possibilities of using different devices that support bluetooth and run on linux to emulate parts of a computer. The idea can be easily ported to other OS's and other output devices.
The goal of this project is to standardize this feature ,giving it flexibility and the ability to be used by anyone that becomes familiar with the concept.

More details about the implementation can be found on the proposal page :
