The goal of this project would be to complete the development of a open source Hybrid honeypot framework. This project would be built to facilitate the deployment of honeynet in large networks. Through a Decision Engine and a Redirection Engine that can drop or replay interesting attack sessions in real time, it would provide a scalable solution to help honeypot researchers and network operators to manage their honeynet.
