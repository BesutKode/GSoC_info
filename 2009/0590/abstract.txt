OAR is an Open Source batch scheduler which provides a simple and flexible exploitation of a cluster. The aim of this project is to make OAR fault tolerant. Indeed, two nerve centers have to be reinforced. OAR server and the database (mysql and postgres). At this time, OAR system is not protected towards scalability. It can become very embarrassing. The idea is to search, compare, test and implement the best solution for server and database fault tolerance.
