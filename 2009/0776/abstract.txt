The goal of this project is to implement support for the System V ABI
in the PowerPC backend of LLVM. Since this is the ABI used on 32-bit
PowerPC Linux, this will effectively bring LLVM to the 32-bit PowerPC
Linux platform. At the moment PowerPC Linux is not officially
supported by LLVM, however the PowerPC backend is considered to be
stable on Darwin.
