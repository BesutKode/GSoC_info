Anubadok is an experimental English-to-Bengali machine translation system developed by G M Hossain. I'm going to port the existing Anubadok system to the framework of Apertium. I plan to implement a Bengali morphological generator. The tagging system also needs to be standardized and then a new transfer system can be written. I think Apertiumâ€™s flexible framework will allow me to implement a language pair as good as Anubadok.
