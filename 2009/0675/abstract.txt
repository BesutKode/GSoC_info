One of the primary uses for using Microsoft Exchange is the ability to share calendars between different users. ICalendar is one of the most popular calendar representations and is an open standard. In order to easily support Exchange calendars in Outlook alternatives, a tool to convert between the two calendar representations is necessary. For these reasons, Openchange must require having a fully functional, robust tool to support bi-directional syncing between ICalendar and an Exchange/Openchange server.
