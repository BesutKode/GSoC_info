This project will extend printer color profile capabilities for Oyranos, a Color Management System (CMS) that allows users to configure ICC profiles.  Currently CUPS has a workable but limited solution for configuring ICC profiles associated with printing devices.  By modifying Oyranos to receive profile data from CUPS, it is possible to utilize a more customizable printer pipelining system for Linux, as well as enhance Kolor Manager (a KDE color manager that uses Oyranos as a backend).
