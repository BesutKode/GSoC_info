Port improvements to Nohalo Level 1 and port Snohalo Level 1 from VIPS to GEGL. Program Nohalo and Snohalo Levels 2 and 3 in demand-driven mode for GEGL with Dr. Robidoux. Test for bugs and optimize for speed. Merge the various methods so that levels are automatically chosen depending on requested quality level, and so Nohalo is selected instead of Snohalo when additional antialiasing is set to zero.
