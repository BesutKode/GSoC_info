What we really need is a Distributed Small Storage System, so save and receive small information pieces.
- find a DHT lib that fits embedded systems
- design a data structure which fits most purposes. 
  This should include future features like crypto signed values for validation, etc
- implement (re)distribution algorithms suitable for a mesh
- lua bindings
- implement a example usage. If there is enough time, implement something useful like
  distributed DNS
