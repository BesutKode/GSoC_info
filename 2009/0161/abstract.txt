Within my internship at IBM Germany GmbH last year, I developed a video driver based on the SDL library 1.2.13 to support Sonys Playstation3. This summer, I would like to integrate the patch into the SDL library and port it to the next major SDL release 1.3. The new video driver allows PS3 users to run SDL applications in "High Definition" resolutions with much more performance. Besides the PowerPC core, SDL is than powered with additional 3 out of 5 SPE cores the Playstation3 provides.
