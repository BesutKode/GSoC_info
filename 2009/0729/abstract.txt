Cytoscape is an open-source platform for complex network analysis and visualization. Filters and Search are part of analysis feature. Filters are currently based on Quick Find plugin. For searching it has two plugins Quick Find and Enhanced Search Plugin (ESP). I will be integrating both Quick Find and ESP which when combined can offer a faster and efficient indexing and searching. The Filters interface will be modified to perform complex queries. Auto completion can also be implemented.
