This project is about planning and implementing an IPv6 and TLS capable superserver in Lua as well as an HTTP/1.1-Server working on top of it using the LuCI HTTP-Stack. This application will serve LuCI - the Freifunk Firmware web user interface - and replace the currently used slower CGI-solution without IPv6 and encryption support. Additionally an RPC-Server will be built to allow remote administration of one or more OpenWrt devices in a standardized way using JSON-RPC over TCP.
