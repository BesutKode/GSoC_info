In the security visualization field there are few tools that show data that occur over a series of definite time steps.  Most are either graphs with a time axis or a network visualization that views network traffic in real time.  This project seeks to create or augment an existing tool to display Sebek data over a series of time steps, at the single instance and network level, to help researchers analyze trends.
