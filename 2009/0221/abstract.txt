Idea here is to develop GNOWSYS-mode, an application for knowledge organization in the GNOWSYS knowledge base through emacs environment. This full featured dialect of LISP programming language will allow command based authoring and modification of GNOWSYS centric knowledge entities/nodes. Thus it will materialise as an application for Getting Things Done in more structured & collaborative fashion and will work as a major-mode in emacs very similar to org-mode or Latex-mode.
