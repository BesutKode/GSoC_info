The project consists in the creation of a fully usable GUI to install, uninstall and upgrade ports as 
well as sync and self upgrade MacPorts. Also I'd like it to have some features to ease the collaboration to MacPorts
(modify Portfiles, create patches and new ports).

 I coded a simple GUI that can handle the installation and uninstallation of ports using the MacPorts.framework. Dowload it here:
