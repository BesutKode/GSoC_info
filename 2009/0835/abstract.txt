MOSES is the cognitive plugin of Opencog Framework, and it plays an important role in the Opencog. The hBOA is used to generate the promising programs as optimal algorithm in MOSES. But it is not the optimal one in this context. Therefore, to improving the efficiency of the optimal algorithm in MOSES is very important and meaningful. The BBHC and simulated annealing algorithm are suitable to be integrated into the MOSES. These integration work would make MOSES better and smarter.
