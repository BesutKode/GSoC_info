RelEx, a component of OpenCog, is a semantic relationship extractor. Each incoming sentence to RelEx is represented as a graph. The main engine of RelEx transforms this graph in an incremental fashion using the rules. The current graph transformation rules are hand-generated. Hand building such rules takes lot of man power, money and time. Here we present a plausible approach to learn and refine these rules automatically using corpus statistics.
