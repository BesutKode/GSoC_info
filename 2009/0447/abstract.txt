Global properties are simple name-value pairs which can be dynamically set and are available systemwide for various purposes. These global properties can be set and edited within the administrative interface of OpenMRS, but this interface's functionality is currently fairly simplistic. We would like the ability to define specific types of global property values (such as a date, or a password, or a medical concept) types to the global properties table to help guide users when entering the data.
