The advent of the mobile phone has made communication simple and portable. However, mobile devices often suffer from unreliable service. This problem can be circumvented and IRC communication made consistent and reliable on Google Android devices by taking advantage of Quassel IRC's client-server model. This project will implement a client to interface with the Quassel IRC core - that is, implement the frontend portion of the client-server model - for Google Android devices.
