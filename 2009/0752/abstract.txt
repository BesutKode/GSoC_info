The aim of this project is to create a web based application for building customized CDs and ready-to-run images for VMs. Web based UI and services can be built with Python. For image building backend, Pardusman - Pardus' own CD image creator which uses PiSi and COMAR frameworks - can be used as a starting point. Virtual machine (may be Parallels, VMware, Xen, Microsoft Virtual PC, QEMU, Usermode Linux, CoLinux, Virtual Iron, VirtualBox or other virtualization technology) image building parts are to be developed from scratch, while most of the installation or live media creation features are complete in Pardusman.
