I am proposing a WYSIWYG theme editor for WordPress. By the end of the GSoC, the theme editor would be capable of altering theme structure, assigning content location and import/export, and would be easily extendable.

Overarching Goals:
—Provide a GUI through which anyone (regardless of skill level) can edit Wordpress themes
—Allow users to create any layout they choose
—Allow content and widgets to be assigned positions and managed visually
—Provide automatic cross-browser compatibility
