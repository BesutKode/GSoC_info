This project will largely improve sftp and turn it into a first class citizen for remote file management. It will have feature parity with scp, and will be able to replace scp seamlessly in existing scripts.
Extra functionality such as tab completion and command improvements will also be implemented to make user's life easier.
Some architectural changes will also be made, to improve sftp's performance in high-latency high bandwidth networks, and with transmission of a lot of small files.
