The Castor project is a quite popular and ongoing data binding and persistence framework. It demonstrates its strength in a wide variety of usage scenarios, embedment in powerful frameworks and a highly participating community. This project intends to implement Java Persistence API interfaces (excluding JPA annotation support and JPA query language) to allow developers the usage of Castor as a JPA persistence provider in a Java environment.
