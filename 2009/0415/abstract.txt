This project is to implement the Sink role on BlueZ, according to the A2DP specification v1.2. This role provide means to receive an audio stream coming from an audio Source on the same piconet. It's very important, and can add several use cases for the Linux bluetooth stack, like Linux to Linux streams, bluetooth microphones support or using a Linux device as bluetooth speakers. It's also a mandatory feature for an implementation to be full compliant with A2DP v1.2.
