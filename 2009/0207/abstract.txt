The collection of package tools that ship with FreeBSD have been recommended for a code cleanup and the addition of new features like package versioning and complete packages.  Adding new features to the tools in their current state would just add new hacks to old code, so I propose a complete rewrite of the package tools, fascilitated by creating and completing a library for handling packages, which would contain new features while maintaining compatibility with the current package system.
