For ages now, Gentoo uses Portage tools as its main package manager. 
Experienced users love the fine-grained customization it offers
thanks to features like the USE flags, masking, etc..
The idea is to port Portage on NetBSD; anyone should be able to download
a stage tarball containing Portage, the tree, and its tools and to use them
on NetBSD.
