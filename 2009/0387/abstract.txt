This project will add multiply to GNOME-Sudoku, using the Telepathy
communication framework, so you can play sudoku with your IM contacts.

The current single-player mode will remain and two new multiplay mode are to be
added: competitive and collaborative.

This project will combine game and instant messaging on the GNOME desktop.
Hopefully, it will serve as an example for further adoption of Telepathy, either
for the other GNOME-Games or other modules in or outside GNOME.
