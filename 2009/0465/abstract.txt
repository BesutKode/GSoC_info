Though XML is becoming an universal standard in protocols and
formats, the Unix world has yet to embrace it fully. A major
obstacle to its integration is the lack of efficient command-line
tools for users and administrators.

This project aims at providing NetBSD with a lightweight,
consistent, set of stream-oriented XML utilities, inspired by
traditional Unix programs such as grep, join and sed, hopefully
opening the way for similar support in other mainstream systems.
