This proposal aims at implementing a WYSIWYG editor for DocBook XML that Fedora uses to author/maintain its documentation. The richness of DocBook can often overwhelm new users. An easy to use tool will attract new contributors and will also provide a convenient alternative to those who are old-timers.The editor will be based on Beacon, an XSLT based plug-able editor. The editor can be used as a stand-alone application or can be integrated with Zikula and Publican.
