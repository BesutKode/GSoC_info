In a non-hierarchical network, trust is an effective method of security against malicious disruptions. Freetalk & FMS are messaging systems backed by a web of trust (WoT) over crypto-identites (IDs). Each ID has a trust list which determines its interaction with other IDs; this interaction also feeds back into the trust system. This project aims to implement a similarly-backed decentralised indexing service, providing search-querying & name-resolution, allowing content to be found much faster.
