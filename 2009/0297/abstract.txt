As of 2009 LaTeX is the de facto standard for equation output, 
with nearly all computer algebra systems being able to output 
expressions in the form of a LaTeX equation.

However, currently the only way to transform a LaTeX equation 
into a format that is suitable for general consumption is to 
invoke `latex`. This process is both slow and requires a 
full-blow latex install. This proposal makes the case for 
externalising the LaTeX parser that exists within Matplotlib.
