My goal is to create an intuitive Python interface to the OpenCog framework via 
the creation of Python language bindings and interactive shell.  The purpose of 
such interfaces is to ease programming for the OpenCog framework, accelerating  
the development A.I. .  Once such interfaces are complete, they will allow one 
to easily write programs/applications that make use of the OpenCog framework 
using only the Python programming language, with no knowledge of C++ required.
