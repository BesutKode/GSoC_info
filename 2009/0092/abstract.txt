Input redirection allows transformation of the input, so that it can match a transformed output. Currently, this is not possible, and input has to be blocked on transformed windows. Currently, input redirection is only available as a set of patches for various x components (by David Reveman). Unfortunately, there are some issues with the patches, as some applications do not behave correctly when transformed. My proposal is to complete the patches, iron out any problems with (potentially broken) applications, and get the patches in a state that can be merged (as it has been waiting for over 2 years, without much happening).
