The application will not need a data connection as it will use data in it's own binary format. The data will be split into countries the can be load separately as needed. To convert data from OSM format to internal application format a separate app will be written. the graphics will be limited to 2D for now, but as it will use Android OpenGL ES libraries the implementation of 3D graphics will be possible in the future.
