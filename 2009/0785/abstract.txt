As a Reyes renderer, Aqsis relies on dicing scene primitives into micropolygons which create all surface detail.  While this method can produce rendered scenes of photographic quality with greater efficiency than previous raytracing methods, a robust dicer implementation must be flexible enough to efficiently dice any degenerate geometry presented to it.  I propose to refactor the Aqsis dicing module with specific optimizations in mind, rewriting critical sections where necessary.
