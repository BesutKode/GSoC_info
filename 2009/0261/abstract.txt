The purpose of this project is to create a web-based utility in PHP that will generate on demand images of Linux installations. Its main purpose will be the creation of embedded systems, with the potential to branch out later for use in installing Gentoo on desktop systems. The project will combine existing tools to give the user maximum control over the final system and make Gentoo much easier to use in machines on which it would be difficult to control or run the installation process locally.
