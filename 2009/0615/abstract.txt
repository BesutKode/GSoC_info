The SCA Domain Manager module provides a web application that allows the administrator to browse through the domain and also add/remove contributions/components/nodes from it. The goal of this project is to implement a search functionality for this module so the user can search for the domain artifacts. Every text that can be searched on a SCA Domain will be extracted via introspection and indexed using Apache Lucene.
