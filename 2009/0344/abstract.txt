Apache Derby is an open source relational database management system implemented in Java. It integrates well with any Java application and it is based on well known standards such as Java, JDBC and SQL. Starting from version 10.2, SQL authorization support was introduced to Derby. But some of the Derby utility tools were not properly updated to cope up with the new feature addition. The objective of this project is to add SQL authorization support to one such tool, namely dblook.
