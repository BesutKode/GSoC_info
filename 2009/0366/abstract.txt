The design of TCP/IP stack of ES OS is based on conduits+model.The work on implementation is already under progress.The aim of the gsoc project will be to define sockets API based on the W3C specifications, to refine design and to integrate excessive four layers of muxes for TCP and UDP, to refine test locking mechanisms around conduits used in the design.The output of the project will be a flexible and stable refinement of TCP/IP stack with all necessary features.
