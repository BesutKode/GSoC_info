ipfw has very flexible internal structure due to representing rules as
a series of opcodes.  But complex ipfw rulesets tend to become a maze
of goto's (skipto opcode) and hard to administrate. I propose to add
support for highlevel domain specific language for specifying ipfw
rules. As rules generated by such translator are going to contain
excessive checks I propose to implement ruleset optimization.
Optimizer doesn't depend on highlevel parser and would be useful on
its own.
