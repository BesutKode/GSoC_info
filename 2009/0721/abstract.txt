Gentoo emerge is checking for file collisions before installing packages. However this collision checking only works after package has been compiled. This is natural since Gentoo is source based and package contents are different for every architecture, set of USE flags and compiler options. Proposed project would provide users and more importantly Gentoo QA team access to database of files in packages from Portage tree. This information can be used for many useful purposes.
