This project is about creating wrapper libraries to support monitoring and management applications to avoid direct use of the FreeBSD kernel memory interface.  This approach would allow the kernel implementation to change and monitoring applications to be extended without breaking applications and requiring them to be recompiled.  For this project, we propose to provide such a library for the network and process functions (i.e. libnetstat and libprocstat).
