Project that I would like to participate in is Tk Photo Image Manipulation and Tk Image Handling. I treat this project as one. I would like to implement support for PNG,MNG formats and also JPEG 2000. Other things that I think would be useful are image rotation, floating point scaling, tinting, fourier transforms and other graphical routines that I mention i my application (gaussian bluring, compering pictures using image descriptors,edge detection)
