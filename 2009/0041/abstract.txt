Dynamic routing is considered as a necessary messaging mechanism on enterprise integration pattern(EIP) because it provides flexible and powerful support for building EIP. Currently, most of the message routing mechanisms don't support a run-time route modification,but on Camel,it has been implemented. Camel can change the routes at run-time using XML.In order to improve it for supporting more languages,we will add support for other languages, such as Groovy, Python or Scala.
