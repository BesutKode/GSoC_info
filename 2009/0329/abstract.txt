Nowadays, netbook is getting popular increasingly. Also, more and more MIPS based netbooks are emerging. Gdium is one of the MIPS(Loongson) based netbook, running Mandriva G-Linux as its operating system. The goal of this project is porting OpenSuSE to MIPS architecture(here it is mips64el), providing more choices to MIPS based
netbook users. Though it may just be a prototype, this project will be the base of further porting work.
