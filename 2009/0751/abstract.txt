BZAuthd was written last summer to address the issues regarding BZFlag's list server which serves the clients with the list of active game servers and authenticates them based on their callsign and password. I propose implementing its missing features, properly testing its functionality to make sure it's ready to be deployed and optimizing it to work well under higher loads. I will also make the necessary changes to existing services to ensure that they are able to work together properly.
