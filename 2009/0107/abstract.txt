In TCL there is a noticable lack of complete and unified printing support,
which is a very desirable feature.

Last year I did one step to improve this situation. This year I would
like to continue my work, and make many improvements in my application
from last year:

* Add better font support for Tktopdf.
* Improve the text widget Tktopdf PDF export function.
* Add Tile widget support to Tktopdf PDF export functions.
