I intend to resolve pending bugs in NSE (Nmap Scripting Engine) including: solve deadlock through generalized detection mechanisms, correct the behavior of NSE with respect to child coroutines of script threads, and eliminate extraneous bugs in the nsock library binding. I shall implement the boolean operators patch for the new Lua implementation. I will finally create a script for crawling a web server to map its contents.
