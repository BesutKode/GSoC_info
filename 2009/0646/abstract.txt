I propose to continue the development of the OpenGL Geometry Editor GUI effort began during Summer of Code 2008 through modifying the existing application to take advantage of the Qt application and UI framework and then taking advantage of the wide array of development tools, widgets, and libraries offered by the framework to rapidly flesh out the front end, with the ultimate goal of preparing a powerful and intuitive CSG modeling GUI ready for connection to the geometry service.
