The main idea is to create a powerful logging system for macports. Goals:
- Provide good and simple logging interface for future use. For example for graphical interface.
- Make ports bug tracking easier for port maintainers.
- To run some time-consuming processes (for example update all ports) and easily track all changes, errors etc.
