Current Cytoscape(CS) has issue such as timeseries data visualization. To cover such usecase, CS needs a new visualizer. Processing is a good toolkit to quickly implement such renderer and new CS3 has cleaner view model and its rendering engine is pluggable. The goal of my project is design and implement simple renderer for CS3 based on Processing and integrating it to CS3's new view-model/VizMapper. This project will be a good test case for CS3's "multiple-view per network model" design.
