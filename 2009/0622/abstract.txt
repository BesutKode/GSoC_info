To translate many documents, many Apertium processes are created and each one loads dictionaries, transducers, grammars etc. from scratch, causing a waste of resources and reducing scalability. A solution is to implement an Apertium Server that doesn't need to reload all the resources for every translation task; this kind of service would be able to handle multiple request at the same time, improve scalability and could be easily included into existing business processes with little effort.
