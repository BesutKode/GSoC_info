This project aims to simulate software systems written in C using Ptolemy II such that the simulation exhibits the same behavior as the execution of the code on a given platform. Furthermore, it should be possible to replace parts of the code, e.g. functions, with Ptolemy models. Instructions in the C code that enable Ptolemy to control execution of code and models as well as appropriate Ptolemy actors dealing with the interaction between C code and models will be created.
