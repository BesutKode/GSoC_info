The tgext.geo project was started as a part of SoC 2008. It provides basic GIS functionality to TurboGears2. It is proposed to enhance tgext.geo into a TG2 Geospatial Web Framework. This would involve developing an SQLAlchemy GIS Extension to support various spatial database features. In addition FeatureServer, a popular python GIS server will be integrated with TG2 to provide a much richer set of GIS functionality.
