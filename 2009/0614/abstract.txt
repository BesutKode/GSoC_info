Create an easy to use database tool for Sharpdevelop which is able to generate definition files for the ADO .NET Entity Framework, an object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. The database explorer is based around MyMeta, an open source API that can be used to get metadata from a database, which is part of the MyGeneration code generator toolset. The support for the Entity Framework will be implemented by integrating the open source Entity Framework Designer on CodePlex.
