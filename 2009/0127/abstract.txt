A KDE 4 application to help non-technical users diagnose and report bugs and issues. This application will provide the following: a Bug Report assistant with automatic inclusion of command dumps and configuration files and a GUI front-end for crash reporting on Bugzilla.

There are two notable projects that strive this functionality: Apport and abrt. This project's goal is to improve on the usability and portability of either and further extend it to fill Pardus's view of the issue.
