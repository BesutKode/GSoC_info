A new technique to perform TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) stack fingerprinting is proposed. Using this technique, the operating system's TCP ISN (Initial Sequence Number) generator is analysed. I conclude that it is possible to recognize operating systems using only one open TCP port on the target machine. Some improvements related to visualization of large networks in RadialNet are proposed too.
