Proposed here is a plan for a plugin for Cytoscape which takes in a phlyogenetic tree as and displays it in Cytoscape. Several of Cytoscapeâ€™s original features are supported in this plugin, such as the ability to manipulate nodes, zooming and exporting a view of the network. New functions that would be beneficial to analyzing phylogenetic trees are proposed such as the ability to collapse subtrees, swap subtrees with the same ancestors and display included information about nodes in the tree.
