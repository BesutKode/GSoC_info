The goal of this project is to implement use of the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) in a SIP network and thoroughly test the resulting network.  In order to verify that SCTP is indeed a better fit for SIP networks, we plan on implementing the proposed architecture inside OpenSIPS, an open source SIP server.  The following phase of the project involves digging deeper into the relationship between SCTP and SIP. What additional features could SCTP add to SIP networks?
