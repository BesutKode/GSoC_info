In Banshee, music is rated, tagged with metadata, categorized, and organized in playlists. Sharing the actual music is only the beginning of what online music sharing can and should be. It would be great if all the hard work of rating songs, adding metadata, and organizing playlists could be shared with our online instant messaging friends. I propose to use Telepathy's excellent D-bus based API to bring some exciting new sharing features to Banshee users.
