Wordpress does not support a mass upload of photos, or the manipulation of a group of photos. The "Photo Grouping by Album" function will offer three functions. One, users can maintain a list of albums. Each album has a one-to-many relationship with photos in the Media Library. Two, users can upload .zip files and Wordpress will extract and put them into one album. Finally, albums can be added to anywhere in a post using a button, or a markup, and each album also has its individual display page.
