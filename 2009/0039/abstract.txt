I believe in NACL. The theory behind it is great. The combination of restricting data access and static analysis will most definitely revolutionize browser security. There’s an unfortunate show stopper though. In addition to being written by humans, it’s mainly written in C/C++. I love C and I am C. But that is where my skills come in. I will not rest until every integer underflow or overflow, buffer overrun, uninitialized memory bug, or other C and x86 quirk is eradicated or made irrelevant.
