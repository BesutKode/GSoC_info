The OpenAFS cache manager keeps two lists of which servers host the files required. Currently, these lists are ordered based on antiquated network architecture assumptions that no longer apply to current network architectures. This project seeks to change the way these lists are ordered by taking into account network conditions that can be estimated based on the Rx peer statistics gathering functionality built into OpenAFS.
