There is currently no automated way to test gPXE's features.  This project would involve implementing an automated regression testing framework to test gPXE's features, both in virtual machines and on real hardware.  This would allow gPXE developers to ensure their modifications do not break existing functionality, and it would allow third-party vendors to verify that their particular hardware works with gPXE.
