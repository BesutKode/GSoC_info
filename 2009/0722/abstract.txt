My project will produce a Drupal 7 version of the Deadwood module incorporating new features such as 1) a grammar parser to enable more complicated conversions and 2) a Conversion API to enable contributed modules to write conversion routines for non-core APIs. The purpose of the module is to automate as much as possible the task of updating a contributed module for Drupal API changes, and thereby simplify the task of porting contributed modules shortly after a new Drupal release.
