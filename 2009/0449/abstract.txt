I would like to work on the TorButton Firefox Extension. There are many feature requests, but I plan to focus on three of them. According to Google Summer of Code, I have ten weeks to complete my project. My plan is to spend three weeks on each feature request, leaving the last week for cleaning up code, finalizing documentation, and tying up any other loose ends. If I end up ahead of schedule, I will either work on adding another feature or I will work on fixing reported bugs.
