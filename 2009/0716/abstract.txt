This project will improve the PyGObject binding and the PyGObject code generator to take advantage of the GObject-Introspection metadata and typelib. PyGObject should be able to load typelibs and create bindings automatically in runtime. It will also extend the code generator to use GIR metadata in additon to defs files, which will make it easier for current bindings to migrate to introspection.
