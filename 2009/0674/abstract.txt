With the creation of Multi-Pointer X (MPX), the possibility of creating Multi-Pointer native applications is possible.  To utilize these features with the currently existent TUIO trackers, I will be writing an xorg-input-tuio driver to receive TUIO events, analyze them, and pass them along as MPX blob events (XBlobEvent).  I will also be creating both CLI and GUI applications to manage and configure the driver and connected TUIO trackers.
