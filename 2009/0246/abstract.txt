In many academic fields, as well as commercial industries, people use clusters to distribute tasks among multiple machines. Many times this is done by packaging a whole operating system disk image and running it in a VM. This project intends to make it easier for Debian to distribute prepared disk images like they distribute CD images now, for the users to recreate or customize these templates with Debian packages and for administrators to host such clusters with Debian.
