A proposal to implement the PTIDES programming model
in Linux. Implementing PTIDES semantics in Linux is difficult
because Linux hard-wires its scheduling semantics. A framework called
Group Scheduling is presented that allows for the creation of arbitrary
programming models in Linux, and offers solutions to achiving precise control
of computations. This prospoal is intended to describe a possible
implementation of PTIDES semantics in Linux using the Group Scheduling
framework.
