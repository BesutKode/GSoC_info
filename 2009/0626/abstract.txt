This project will involve the re-implementation of INFORMATION_SCHEMA. The current information schema implementation experiences performance problems due to its design and implementation. For instance, there is extra overhead during execution due to the fact that the current implementation uses SQL derived tables internally. This new implementation of information schema is desired by the Drizzle community as it is needed so that the developers can standardize on a handler interface easily. Performance problems caused by the current information schema will also be alleviated by this new implementation. Also, I see this project as something which is a perfect fit for a project with a 3-month time-frame.
