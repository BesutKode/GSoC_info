Hackystat provides numerous tools for allowing users to analyze patterns in their programming behaviors; I will build upon this functionality by adding features that will allow users to identify trends in the software development community at large. A relational graph constructed using data from social networking sites in addition to Hackystat data will be mined to develop predictive models that users can query to gain a better understanding of how social networks impact coding practices.
