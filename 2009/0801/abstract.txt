Abstract:

I wish to take up Coverage Analysis of RTEMS as a project for the Google Summer of Code initiative, 2009. The aims of the project are as follows:

1. To perform automated coverage testing and analyse the object level coverage provided by the RTEMS test suite
2. Identify and report parts of code that are not being exercised under the test suites
3. Analyse each case separately and classify into categories previously identified.
4. Address each of these cases and eliminate them.
