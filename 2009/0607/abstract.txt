Goal
 - Revamp the Rhythmbox iPod/MTP interface, so that it is easier and more intuitive to use.
 - It should be able to recognize "identical" songs, and track new/removed songs.
 - It should be able to 'sync' your device, automatically (or on command).
 - Sync-ing backend should be as unified as possible between MTP and iPod players.
