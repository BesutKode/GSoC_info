One of the drawbacks the XO laptops suffer from is the lack of a printing scenario. My project will not only add USB printing and include a moodle CMS plug-in which will feature a teacher moderated/intervened environment through which the teacher will be able to check the print jobs from students and approve/disprove accordingly, but it will also be having a PDF conversion facility which can be used on the image/doc mime types saved in the XO datastore for conversion.
