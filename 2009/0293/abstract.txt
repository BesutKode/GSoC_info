The purpose for this project is to enhance Tux Typing so that it can be of greater use to educators, both in and out of the classroom setting. The project would have two major objectives. First: Make it possible for users to easily create (and save) word/phrase lists. Second: Provide feedback to the user about their strengths and weakness in the form of a possible 'report card' that informs the user what letters they need to work on for improvement.
