Extension to SharpDevelop's debugger. Displays selected data structure used in the program as directed graph, which is updated live as the user steps through the code.
Developers could understand code more quickly by immediately seeing how are the objects in the program related.
Computer science teachers could use it to explain algorithms, and the students could visually "replay" the algorithms later just by having the code.
There is no such tool available yet.
