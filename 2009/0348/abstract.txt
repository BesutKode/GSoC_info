Crunchy, with lineage in the 2006 GSOC, is educational software written in Python designed to teach Python through web page tutorials that allow users to interact with the interpreter. This project will create a working Python 3 branch of Crunchy in preparation for increased interest in learning Python 3, both for new and old programmers. Along the way, I hope to also increase regression and functional testing in the existing code as a secondary goal.
