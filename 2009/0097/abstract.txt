While it is easy to use and functional, the existing default, Qt based GUI for VLC is quite minimal and basic. I propose to develop a new "Media Center" style GUI. This GUI will be based on Qt/OpenGL and will aim to be aesthetically pleasing, while remaining easy to use and functional. It will draw on many nice features of other popular media center software such as Front Row, Windows Media Center and XBMC.
