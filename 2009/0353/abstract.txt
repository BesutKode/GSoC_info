Currently Hackystat provides an API to access its collected sensor data from external resources, however publishing sensor data as RDF Linked Data on the Web can significantly increase benefits for both Hackystat end users and third-party applications. I plan to transform current sensor data in new “linked sensor data” represented as RDF descriptions and to start working from the 20th of April.
