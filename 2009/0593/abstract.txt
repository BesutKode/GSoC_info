The objective of my project is to add support for writing PostgreSQL functions in managed code. PostgreSQL functions are often referred to as "stored procedures", but apart from that usage they serve a broad range of purposes. They are are used for implementing triggers, adding new operators and creating new data types. My project will allow all these tasks to be done in CLR languages.
