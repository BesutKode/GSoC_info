Implement VFS-style union mounts in the Hurd. The idea is to provide a
possibility to use VFS-style union mounts under the GNU/Hurd system
via a special translator. This would allow for flexible usage of the
main filesystem and a uniform access to different types of filesystems
(which could be normal filesystem and virtual, ``hurdish''
filesystems).

Also, implement some ``magic'' rules which would allow *controlled*
union mounts; this could include translator manipulations.
