Kolf2 is the second incarnation of KDE's minigolf game. The developers are currently rewriting it from scratch to take advantage of the powerful technologies provided by Qt 4 and KDE 4.  Some objects in the game scene were already been created, such as WallObject, CircleBlockObject, some objects are still waiting for constructing. I am going to implement the landscape objects for Kolf2, the objects will be slopes, puddles, sand bunkers and etc.
