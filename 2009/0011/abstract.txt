The Connector Tool in Inkscape does not allow the user do define specific connector points and also lacks orthogonal routing of connectors. By participating in this project I intend to help implementing the following improvements: adding a GUI for entering connector points and also the involving SVG metadata handling code; extending libavoid functionality to permit orthogonal routing and making it available to Inkscape; adding a feature similar to Knot LPE for connectors (mark crossings).
