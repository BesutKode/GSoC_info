Building a new version of upas/fs, based on the previous work of Erik Quanstrom (his project nupas) would evolve the system as it was suggested in the International Workshop on Plan9. 

The key issues to be addressed would be memory usage efficiency, searching and tagging of email messages and increasing system responsiveness,using threads. With these additions, the plan9 email system,and its users, would benefit of those widely used features already present in most email management systems.
