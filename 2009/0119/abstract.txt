The goal of this project is to organize all of the ways that Asterisk stores data, and provide a generic API for accessing and updating the data while an instance of asterisk is running. This project will focus on storing the data and keeping it available in memory. The specific implementation and project details can be discussed in detail at the start of the Google Summer of Code project.
