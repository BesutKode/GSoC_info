Voting is a dying habit. Each individual in our country has the opportunity to create change in our government. Yet, most people only vote once or twice during the year, then sit back and wait until next year. This project will change the way we think about voting.

Through this proposed system, any user will be able to vote on public policy issues on a national and state level. Politicians will be able to gauge interest on issues and respond to questions and concerns.

Letâ€™s get represented!
