I wish to implement a task-based work flow for Melange, where the program administrator, organization admin and mentors will
be able to define tasks, tag them, set difficulty levels and track students' progress for each task. Also students will be able to look
at tasks, claim them, work on them, indicate their progress for tasks claimed and submit their work. Also I wish to provide Melange some automated features for processing student submissions and selection of students for prizes.
