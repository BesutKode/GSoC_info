The Usability Testing Suite1 that I created during SoC 20082 needs additional work in order to make it ready for use3.  The existing module provides a powerful API that makes writing data collection plug-ins simple, but the user interface needs refinement and a screen recording plug-in would make the module much more helpful.  Through this project I intend to finalize the Usability Testing Suite and make it ready for widespread use.
