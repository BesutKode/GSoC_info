As the Ruby on Rails community grew, several options appeared in front of Rails default choices: ActiveRecord as ORM, Prototype as javascript framework and Test::Unit for tests. In my GSoC project I will extend generators to gain the modularity needed to deal with agnosticism and also allow plugin developers to extend Rails scaffold behavior easily. As proof of concept, at the end of the summer one of the most desired features will be added to Rails: tests agnosticism.
