CCAN's focus this year is pretty straightforward:  Improve ccanlint so it will be easy for users to submit high-quality CCAN modules.  Thus, I propose bringing two key improvements to ccanlint:  additional tests to ccanlint, and a ccanlint GUI.  The tests will help eliminate errors in contributed libraries, their test suites, and in example code.  The GUI will be a simple wizard to guide contributors through the steps of creating metadata and running the gauntlet of tests.
