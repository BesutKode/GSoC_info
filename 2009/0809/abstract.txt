Scilab currently uses OpenGL through it's Java bindings - JOGL - to render 2D and 3D graphics. This implementation has disadvantages. It is difficult to code and maintain due to the interaction between Java and C++, has performance issues and is difficult to integrate with the Java/Swing GUI. The aim of this project is to overcome these limitations by implementing graphics rendering in VTK.
