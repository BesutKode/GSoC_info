Scilab's function fsolve computes a root of a system of nonlinear
equations. Currently, fsolve is a wrapper around the subroutine HYBRD.
HYBRD is well suited to solving systems with dense derivatives, but
can not solve large systems with sparse derivatives. I propose to
improve the current interface to HYBRD, construct a test set of
nonlinear systems with dense and sparse derivatives, and implement an
experimental solver for systems of nonlinear equations with sparse
derivatives.
