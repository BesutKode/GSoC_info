As of the current 3.0 codebase, which is planned for release in the near future, BZRobots does not properly run on any platform. The last working release only ran under Linux, was untested under OS X, and there has never been a working Windows release of BZRobots. The ultimate goal of this project is to have a BZRobots system with a clean, well-documented, easy to use API that can be used to build robots that operate in the BZFlag environment on all three major platforms.
