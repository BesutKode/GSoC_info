My idea is an extension of exebuf to make it a universal tool for searching and selecting files and running them with appropriate programs. As a rough sketch my plan is to provide interfaces for pluggable backend modules to retrieve files via locate or tracker and backends that provide actions to act on files like looking up matching applications that can open a given mimetype or sending them. For the view my idea is to have virtual folders in efm that shows the found candidates to act on.
