We already know that phoneyc is a low interaction client honeypot which is designed for the deobfuscation and detection of malicious content in the wild. But since its framework is quite different from a browser, this limits its ability to do the deobfuscation. In order to do further improvements on PHoneyC, first we must simulate DOM objects in javascript, and then solve other problems of real-time interaction. We wish to focus on these in the GSoC project.
