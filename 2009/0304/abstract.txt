This application proposes a number of modifications on Django, with the aim of providing web developers with more tools to localize their projects.

Django already provides some i18n features, but it lacks many others such as date and number formatting, and translation of dynamic content.

Developments detailed in this application will make Django projects easily localized. Also these changes will be useful for implementing future i18n features, inside Django or as external applications.
