I am doing a Master in Security and Mobile Computing and I am a Mac user that has previously used Linux. I had courses in Human Machine Interface and I have good programming skills in C, Java and C++. Adding to that I am really motivated to work with you, I enjoyed the (small) work I did with you, trying to make Openswan compile in OS X, and I look forward to make this GUI.
