I'm proposing to create a tool (that will be called Kameleon) whose purpose will be to generate OAR appliances or iso images. OAR project already have a script that creates a LiveCD from the debian packages. I'm intending to start from this script and add the following features: support for rpm based distributions, support for various output formats (cow, iso, tgz), auto-config for virtual cluster (i.e. ZeroConfig).
