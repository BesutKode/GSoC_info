A global outbox is a shared Akonadi collection that applications can put their emails into, and Akonadi will take care of sending them. This reduces code duplication, provides convenient centralized control, and allows applications to send email without having to load a full instance of KMail. My project is to implement a standalone mail composing library based on KMime, a global outbox collection and mail dispatcher agent for Akonadi, and to begin porting applications to this new framework.
