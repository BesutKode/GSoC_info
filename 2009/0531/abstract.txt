Melange is now the heart web app which manages Google Summer of Code (and which will manage GHOP). The program counts every year thousands of students and mentors coming from all over the world. Handling all this data is an awesome opportunity to have great visual representations of this special open source nursery. What I would like to do is developing a statistics module to let all these cold numbers and data relationships come out from binary code to eyecandy.
