TFACES is a suite of tools designed to make the entire process of computational modeling simpler, from implementation to interpretation.  In implementation, TFACES simplifies the process of data management.  In interpretation, TFACES simplifies the process of cross-sectional data extraction and analysis.  While TFACES reduces the complication of modeling, it does not increase the speed.  There is fertile ground for the implementation of components and analysis of computational models on GPU.
