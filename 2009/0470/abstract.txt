Audit is a critical element in operating system security evaluation.With this project an effort will be done to design and implement an application audit system, that will allow application-specific security events to be recorded and managed with an efficient, reliable and trustworthy way.That could be a great addition to the current TrustedBSD project, as it will allow sysadmins to monitor application related security events and consequently enhance application-centric security evaluation.
