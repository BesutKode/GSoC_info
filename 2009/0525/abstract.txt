The profile based traffic routing system will build road profiles from user submitted gps data to be used with routing support via pgRouting. The submitted data will be compared to OpenStreetMap data to correlate collected field data with existing roads and assign edge weights based on actual driving speeds.  All collected data will be retained and aggregates used to determine link weights.  In this way multiple users can submit data to such an application while favoring their individual data.
