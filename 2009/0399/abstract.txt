Moca is an end-to-end remote medical diagnostics application that runs on Google Android phones and integrates with OpenMRS. This project involves adding powerful functionality for OpenMRS patient authentication directly from a mobile handset, even in an out-of-coverage-area scenario, and will entail programming in Java using the Android SDK and incorporating a number of technologies into the system.
