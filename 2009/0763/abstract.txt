PDF is no question the de facto standard for outputting electronic documents. making Scribus's PDF output more flexible in term of users' requirements is highly desirable. This project aims to address a few important improvements that could be applied to Scribus's PDF exporting features. The main focus will be supporting PDF/X-1a, PDF/X-4 export and improving the embedding PDFs feature of Scribus. As the project goes, it could extend, where appropriate, to cover the font subsetting features.
