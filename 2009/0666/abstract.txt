Jacl's latest release supports Tcl 8.0 commands where there is 8.5 already. This idea concentrates to implement new commands (including 'fileevent', regexp and pipes) and modernize the old ones. I'm a  Java enthusiast and I want to join the Tcl and Jacl community to continue this project. With my experience in Java I am ready to carry this project and successfully finish it. I have an aim to help the community to release another version of Jacl by my implementation.
