Current Gridway environment does not provide users with a Graphical interface for monitoring and submitting jobs. The changes can be made using GTK+ or The GIMP Toolkit  which will use the existing infrastructure  of DRMAA API (C bindings). The existing command line interfaces will be supported in Graphical User Interface so that users would be able to compose,manage,synchronise and control their jobs just by clicking the graphical interface instead of the commands.
