A musical toolkit is an ideal candidate to test the viability of creating a platform based on OpenFrameworks for developing an accessible & extensible musical interface builder. The thrust of this project will focus on the research and development of an OF addon for users to build OpenGL-powered interfaces for musical (and media) applications. This project should demonstrate the feasibility of future interface solutions built on top of OpenFrameworks.
