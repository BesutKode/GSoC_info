I propose the development of a component-based UI framework for Java.  This framework will allow Java developers to create interfaces for their Java applications that support a variety of advanced forms of HCI.  Developers instantiate UI components, and component listeners to hook into their application code.  The components of the framework will already know how to respond to a variety of HCI actions.  The framework will simultaneously expose a component-based system for defining new gestures.
