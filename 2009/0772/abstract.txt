The next generation of the JDK will contain a number of updates to better host dynamic languages. These updates aim at improving the performance of dynamic languages as well as the interoperability in between languages.

These do not come for free. Invokedynamic is implemented as a new opcode and a new set of APIs to manage method handles and call sites. Interface injection is a new set of APIs. To be able to benefit from these additions, Jython needs to be adapted.
