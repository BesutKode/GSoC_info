The WinLibre Package Manager is an open source project for the Google Summer of Code 2009. The goal of the project is to design and develop a Package Manager for the Windows operating system.  The development of such software would not only help the end users to help them deploy open source applications on windows but also the open source developers by enabling them to focus only on their software while the package manager will handle the job of resolving dependencies.
