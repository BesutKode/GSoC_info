gPXE currently features a limited command language. A more powerful scripting language would allow users to specify boot policies or other customizations as a script, without having to understand gPXE completely, or having to edit its code.

The following features seem indicated:
boolean operators
bitwise operators
conditional branches
arithmetic operations
temporary variables
The exact structure needs to be identified and refined, so as to be intuitive and efficient at the same time.
