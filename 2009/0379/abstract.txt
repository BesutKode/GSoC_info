To lower the usability and portability threshold of the Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF), it should be possible to visually edit model instances from a standard web browser. This a task for which the GEF/Draw2d/SWT stack is not well-suited, and thus a browser-based diagram editing environment is needed. Additionally, it should be possible to use the same workflow provided by the Graphical Modelling Framework (GMF) to generate domain-specific, browser-based diagram editing environments.
