The project is to extend current resource limits so that they can be specified not only per-proccess, but also per-user, per-job and per-jail.  Idea is somewhat similar to the resource management scheme used in SunOS.  It should make life easier for administrators of machines where users have access to shell account, such as shared hosting servers or university machines.
