I propose to design an infrastructure for 802.11 cards to be used by Etherboot, and as many drivers for it as I have time for. Currently there is only one driver for any 802.11 device (prism2) and it's out-of-date and unsupported by any 802.11 infrastructure. My work will expose parameters like SSID and encryption settings, and handle the high-level parts of 802.11 to lessen the difficulty of writing drivers. To make it useful I will implement some of those drivers myself.
