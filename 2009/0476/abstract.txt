Freenet allows friends to be added as darknet connections. This is optional and doesn't give many benefits to the end user.

An important part of getting the darknet to grow is to give benefits to the users that have darknet friends added. The benefits could either be new features or improvements in performance. The goal of the project is to implement such features and improvements in performance.
