PyDy is an analysis and visualization tool for studying and teaching the dynamics of mechanical systems. It allows for symbolic derivation of the equations of motion, their numerical integration, and animation of the motion, all within the Python environment. Built on top of Sympy, Scipy, and Visual Python, it enjoys the benefits of LaTeX output, web interactivity, and low overhead. PyDy is unique because all steps of simulating realistic motion are available to the user in one place.
