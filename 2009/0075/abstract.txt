We cannot stay alone anywhere in the world. So that is also true for the cyberspace also.. High interoperatability means you can survive in the jungle for a long time. 
Like that Joomla need to be interoperated better than ever. So as you've mentioned in the Ideas page its' wise to integrate Elgg and Wordpress into the Joomala...

My Idea is to not to stop from there and create a common gateway to make interconnection with other networks..
So while getting more concentration to the Elgg and Wordpress in future communities in the internet can connect with Joomla using this gateway...
