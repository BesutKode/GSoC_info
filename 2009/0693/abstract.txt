I'm goint to improve TDBC driver to make it more versatile by:
* Implementing new drivers and adapters to existing interfaces
* embedding other connectivity projects under TDBC and using it as a slave below others. 

I was brought to Tcl/Tk by Tomasz Kosiak and I have a face-to-face contact with him as I work part time for a DAC System. Tomasz assured me, that he can give me positive references for work I have done for him.
