This project proposes to develop a one step Bluetooth setup wizard that can simplify the device setup process by using a single 2D DataMatrix symbol containing device MAC address, SDP record etc. This is contrary to the traditional setup where a device setup relies on a time intensive inquiry and service search. A GUI and a BlueZ plugin is  also planned to be developed for importing symbols from  image file or webcam.
