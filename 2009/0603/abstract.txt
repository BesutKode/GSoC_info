At the present moment, heap profiling Haskell programs means analysing logs off-line, using conversion tools to visualise data. However, instead of generating graphs with hp2ps, it should be possible to present the data in a graphical application in real time, which is useful while developing interactive applications. This project aims at creating an interactive profiler as well as a Haskell reimplementation of hp2ps to resolve some long-standing issues and improve its maintainability.
