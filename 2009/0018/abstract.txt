I will try to implement the WYSIWYG Form Designer for Html Form Entry Module, as described in your Unassigned Projects page.

The first priority would be to use existing software (tinymce or fckeditor) for the WYSIWYG Designer, by developing a plugin (ideally) or by modifying the code to suit the project needs.
