Synopsis

The main goal of my project will be to develop a powerful, very well documentated, enhanced library for working with images that would include:
- thumbnails generating;
- watermarks;
- rotate and flip;
- effects like sepia, negative, grayscale, blur, invert;
- brightness and contrast fixes.

There were previous attempts to do such a thing but they had the disadvantage that they could not be used in external components.
