A tool that cycles through and animates a user specified list of features would help to visually differentiate datasets, pathways, and attributes from and within large biological networks. These features would be sets of nodes and edges that would be generated based upon the network topology and data attributes. They would then be made available for the user to specify which features to animate within the network along with what visual attributes should be assigned to each feature.
