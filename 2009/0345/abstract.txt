In this project. I will develop RTEMS BSP for PXA255 targets which are simulated by SKYEYE simulator. Shut-down device and maximum execution time parameter will be implemented to SKYEYE simulator, which will benefit automatic testing framework of RTEMS. At the end of this project, the BSP should passes all relevant single processor tests and samples which reside in “rtems/testsuites”, network demos, Nano-X demos and class examples.
