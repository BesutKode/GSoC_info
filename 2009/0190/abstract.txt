The goal of this project is to further develop vector network analysis in GRASS. This would involve computation of many centrality measures(degree, closeness, betweeness, eigenvalueâ€¦), requested v.net.distance module, time tables integrated into routing, various algorithms such max flows, min cuts, weakly and strongly connected components, minimum spanning trees, all pairs shortest paths, k-connectivity, articulation points, bridges, etc.
