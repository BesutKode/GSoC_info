This proposal aims to provide a plugin for Tbeta that could allow Hand, Fingers and Blobs recognition and Tracking, but most importantly to make an association and see if they belong to each other, and later to provide this information on the TUIO string, permiting the applications developers to make use of the new data on a wide range of applications. It envisions then, to augment the opportunities provided by the already amazing Tbeta.
