This is a proposal for implementing a Graphical Class Designer Add In for MonoDevelop. It will provide an interactive graphical editor for visualize and modify the class hierarchy. The graphical class editing would be tightly synchronized with the source code. An important part o the project will be the canvas widget that could be reused not only for other related project such as a database designer but for all kind of applications.
