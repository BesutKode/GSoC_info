Bot module is a Drupal PHP IRC bot written by Morbus Iff. It runs on many Drupal related channels, providing various tools from code documentation to collaboration between users. It utilizes the CMS as its storage and code handling back-end, but until now not many public modules exploit the potential in this website - IRC interaction, interacting with Drupal content, site users for instance. This project will extend its core in this direction, and by writing tests and documentation for it will make further contribution easier.
