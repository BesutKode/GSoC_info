Since the 2.6.29 version, Linux kernel supports the Access Point mode for mac80211 drivers. However, there is no simple GUI tools available, which would let users set their own AP easily. This project purpose is to add the AP mode support to NetworkManager using hostapd or wpa_supplicant. That will require creating a suitable dbus interface for hostapd or moving hostapd's functionality to wpa_supplicant. GUI tools for managing the Access Point mode will be delivered too.
