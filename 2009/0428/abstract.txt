As the Python desktop applications grew very fast, the need for a general, platform independent keyring API ,becomes important for development. Many services require authentication before they can be used. Application always needs to store these authentications safely.

This lib is aimed to address this problem. By making a single call to this library, an application can store login information on a keyring where the application can retrieve the information—also with a single call—when needed.
