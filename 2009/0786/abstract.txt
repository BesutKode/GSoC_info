The Ext2 or extended file system is a file system developed by RÃ©my Card and others for the Linux kernel. The ext2fs or it's derivatives are used as the Linux operating system's native file system format today. Ext2 is still preferred on flash drives as it requires fewer write operations (since it has no journal). FreeBSD has had Ext2 support for a long time. The current implementation suffers from some problems and it's GPL'd.
