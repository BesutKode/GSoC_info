Abiword for Windows is an ANSI application, written mainly in C++. Porting Abiword for Windows completely to Unicode has been considered for a long time. Earlier researches were done to make it possible to build for both the ANSI and Unicode API. As the earlier versions of Microsoft have now become obsolete, this project targets the descendants of Windows NT and porting the existing ANSI application to a Unicode only build. The known bugs of the application are addressed in this project.
