Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) represent many of the most difficult problems facing the modern world. Agent-based models (ABMs) have become an excellent approach to solving these problems. ABMs attempt to model  complex systems by directly modeling the unique individuals (agents) that make up the system. This means that ABMs require considerable computing power, and as such, this project will ultimately attempt to develop an API that provides common ABM operations implemented on GPUs.
