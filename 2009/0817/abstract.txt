The next version of HTML standard (HTML5) brings a new feature: What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editors support. It's already widely used on the web for different rich text editing (wordpress, gmail, etc). 
The default KDE layout engine, KHTML, is currently not good at supporting editing features. My project is to adapt and extend the existing framework to have full-featured and standard-compliant implementation of WYSIWYG editing.
