The current MapReduce implementation of OMII-SAGA does not take advantage of some optimization possibilities such as support for combiner functions, consideration of data locality for mappers, serialization and compression of intermediate data, for example. The aim of this project is to enhance SAGA-MapReduce so that it will be more effective and competitive in solving real-world scientific problems.
