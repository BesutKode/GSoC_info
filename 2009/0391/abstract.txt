In this project, I will characterize the performance of Globus GridFTP transfers over both TCP and UDT protocols for hosts connected at 10Gb/s over a wide area network, and compare the performance of GridFTP using each. Standard disk-to-disk GridFTP transfers will be tested, as well as memory-to-memory transfers. Characterization will include detailed measurements regarding the speed and latency involved in the transfers, as well as resource utilization at the source and destination hosts.
