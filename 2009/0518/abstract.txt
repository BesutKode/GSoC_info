While Plone has a unique combination of pluggable extensibility & easy custom content type creation; it falls short in its ability to seamlessly interoperate with the semantic web. Conversely, the RDF framework while powerful, is difficult to use even by data architects.This project proposes to begin the process of making RDF a pluggable component of Plone that users can leverage to import/export ontologies, enrich their content with ontological classes/relationships, & eventually reason over it
