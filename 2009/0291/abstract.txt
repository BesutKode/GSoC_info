Currently the basic infrastructure of the FLOW3 Security Framework is implemented. To make the framework usable in real life a lot functionality is needed. E.g. we will have to provide many authentication mechanisms to integrate FLOW3 applications flawlessly in existing infrastructures.
With the proposed features we will also proceed in our mission to provide a transparent security framework, which supports the developer as much as possible to write secure web applications without the need of being a security specialist.
