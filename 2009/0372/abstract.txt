Hugin currently is largely unaware of stacks and rows of images. I plan to let the user specify the row, column, and bracket of the images, but also try to automatically find them after alignment. They can then use this model help with optimisation of image positions and show each bracket individually in the preview windows. The information can also be used to identify image pairs that should be connected with control points.
