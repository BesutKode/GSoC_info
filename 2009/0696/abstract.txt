Thandy is the secure software updater developed by the Tor project
to assist users with keeping their Tor related software up to date.
I intend to resolve one of the issues that prevent deployment as
of now, which is the content distribution issue. To achieve this
goal, I will include libtorrent in Thandy; as well as set up a
Tracker with the ability to learn about new Thandy packages.
