The goal is to have a instance of the Build Service where users can log in with an OpenID.

The specific requirements are:

    * Enabling users to login and register with OpenID
    * OpenID UI for the Web front end
    * Associating an API key with user
    * Extending the Authentication mechanism of API to support login via API key
    * Evaluating/Implementing OAuth to provide access to API 

Login through OpenID will provide a better user experience to the Web Front end users.
