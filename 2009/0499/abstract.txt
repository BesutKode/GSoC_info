This is a follow-up of last year's GSoC project that built a coreboot BIOS payload consisting of a KVM-enabled Linux kernel. It could start OpenBSD's installer, but crashed soon after because Thread Local Storage support was missing from uClibc.
This year's project intends to build upon last year's project and implement the things that didn't make it last year, namely fix the cause of the crashes and make some improvements to allow it to be used in mass production and deployed on real hardware.
