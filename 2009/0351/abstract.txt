This project will involve the porting of "Mines", a current GNOME game, to Seed, utilizing Clutter bindings in order to make a beautiful, 2.5D rendition of the classic game. It will also include the completion of the final layer of polish on the two Seed GNOME Games: Lights Off and Same Gnome. Work will first be done in order to make the GNOME Games support library work with GObject-Introspection, which will be required in order to write complete games in Seed.
