(1) Service management.  We now have about six or so services that run as a standard part of a Hackystat system, with more on the way.  Unfortunately, all of these services need to be configured and run individually. Also, if one goes down, we have no way to knowing.  A huge benefit would be to create a framework that allows easy downloading, deployment, and monitoring of these services.
