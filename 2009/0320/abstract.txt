Glastopf is a minimalistic web server emulator, written in Python. Glastopf collects web application based attack information like remote file inclusions, SQL-inclusions and local file inclusions. The attack data is stored in a MySQL-database that can be browsed via a web interface. Recently, a very early, stable version of Glastopf was released. The unstable branch has a lot more features, but most of them are lacking some love. I am planning a new stable release within the next weeks.
