When building Web applications, developers expect the tools they use to be fully interoperable through clean protocol implementations.  This project aims to ensure full HTTP/1.1 compliance in the Mojo Web Framework, through both whitebox and blackbox testing.  Time permitting, Mojo’s client code will also be exercised through the development of a smart User-Agent similar to LWP’s.
