When using cryptographic algorithms it is necessary to evalutate their security suitability. DSSC is a new IETF specification which could evaluate the algorithms' security suitability. Through adding DSSC implementation into PKIF,we can improve the PKIF's existing support for digital signature preservation. In this proposal,we implement the DSSC policies' parsing,authenticating and processing,using existing PKIF subsystems for authentication.
