This project involves delivering a working solution to the licensing problems in FreeBSD for the end of this SoC, such as automatically identifying GPLv3 ports, restricted distfiles, incompatible licenses, etc.

It consists on committing the (already working) code from the start with minimal/normal functionality, and enabling advanced features (which are automated) later, when the respective requirements are met (i.e. FOSSology works on FreeBSD).
