During my time with the Berkman Center I will work on developing the Cohort CRM Ruby on Rails web application. My primary goal during development will be extracting the already present hierarchical tagging functionality into a plugin, both for reusability and to clean up the application. Since this project is in heavy development I will also be assisting my mentor in developing the application as it goes through a couple releases in the near future.
