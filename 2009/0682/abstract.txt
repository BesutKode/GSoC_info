This project aims to implement better approaches for program comprehension and developer interaction with software artefacts in KDevelop by means of code visualization mechanisms. For that purpose, I will introduce features for control flow graphs and polymetric visualization, implemented as part of an extensible framework that will facilitate the future development of new visualization paradigms (treemaps, class/package dependency, dynamic, evolution etc).
