IEC 68831-6 (AMDTP) is the standard  for most (semi-) professional FireWire audio interfaces. Currently, support in Linux for such devices is provided by the FFADO daemon, which relies on libraw1394 library. 

This project sets the goal of partly moving into the kernel (as a FireWire driver with an ALSA interface) what FFADO currently implements in userspace.

THe impact: huge! It will push Linux even further in becoming a top choice as a music recording and production platform!
