Currently FreeBSD has limited support for userlevel file systems with
GPL licensed fuse port (fusefs-libs) and kernel module
(fusefs-kmod). There are some known design drawbacks in
this implementation which can't be easily fixed.

I'd like to port puffs (Pass-to-Userspace Framework File system) from
NetBSD. I'd suggest not to preserve compatibility with NetBSD, but to
develop a port preserving FreeBSD native VFS interface and fix
librefuse and ported userlevel file systems (psshfs).
