Routing is a very fundamental task in geographic applications, and pgRouting is a famous routing library which provides routing functions for many GIS software, such as PostGIS/PostgreSQL. As the growing of data size, routing becomes time consuming. To pgRouting, I want to integrate a new shortest path algorithm, Mild-TWO-Q, which is proved to be a very fast algorithm.
