From the minix gsoc website:
We would like you to implement a new compiler-based fault injection tool which can be used for reliability testing on MINIX 3 . This should improve the existing Software Implemented Fault Injection (SWIFI) tool included in the MINIX distribution, which is based on tracing and can only be used for a limited number of OS components. We would like the new tool to be implemented as an LLVM transformation pass, to inject faults in predetermined program locations at compile- or link-time. Candidates for this project should be familiar with static program instrumentation techniques. Experience with the LLVM compiler framework is recommended. A successful project can lead to a publication in an international conference, which can be very helpful if you want to apply to a graduate school later this year.
