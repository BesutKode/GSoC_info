The Java Path Finder uses a set of so called model classes in alternative to the standard library classes. These classes are expected to show the same behaviour of their standard library counterpart, where the 'behaviour' is represented by the public and protected members a class has. To prevent bugs, it is important that this behaviour is exactly the same of the standard library counterpart and an automated tool is needed to ensure this conformance.
