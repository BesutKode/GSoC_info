DBpedia Spotlight is a tool that can automatically annotate mentions of DBpedia resources from text documents. In the information age, more and more contents are published on the Internet. It is valuable to introduce DBpedia functionality for users to conveniently annotate the web page during browsing.
In addition, some recent researches have indicated that collective disambiguation (consider the disambiguation decisions of related mentions in a context as a whole) will result in a better performance than merely context based disambiguation. Introducing collective disambiguation techniques to DBpedia Spotlight may help enhance the overall annotation quality.
