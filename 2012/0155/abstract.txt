The current defacto assembly language for Parrot, PIR, and the IMCC compiler that processes it are often considered to be a limitation in Parrot development. PIR hides much of the details of the bytecode and IMCC is considered difficult to extend or fix. This project has the aim of creating an in-VM library for producing bytecode and a simple assembly language targeting it as a proof of concept.
