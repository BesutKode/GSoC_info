My aim is to bring the knowledge acquired in my experience to help the enhancement and continuous growing of PCL library. I expect to give my contribution through the improvement of pcl modules and the development of new functionalities. My focus is on tracking, filters, keypoints, registration, and tree-based structures like kdtree and octree. However, I'm available to work on any module as well.
