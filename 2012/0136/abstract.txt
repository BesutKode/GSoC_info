There is no Hybrid mobile app for a user to view all his photos stored in various online social networking sites and storage sites at one place. The goal of this project is to solve the aforementioned problem.
Through this project, I intend to develop a hybrid app that will stream all photos a user has uploaded on various sites like Facebook, Picasa, and Flickr etc. by making use of APIs of these sites. This app will be developed using Phonegap.
