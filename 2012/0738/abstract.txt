Computing aggregates over a cube of several dimensions is a common operation in data warehousing. In Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) systems, a cube is a way of organizing data in N-dimensions so as to perform analysis over some measure of interest. Measure is a term used to refer numerical facts that can be algebraic(SUM, COUNT etc.) or holistic (DISTINCT, TOP-K etc.).  The aim of this project is to provide support for cube computation over massive datasets using Apache Pig. It extends my current na√Øve implementation of cube operator to support efficient cube computation for algebraic and holistic measures.
