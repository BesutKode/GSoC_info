With growing media collections it gets difficult to quickly find specific media files. For that purpose filtering can be employed which allows specifying rules to narrow down the listed media files. The goal of this project is to integrate the filtering functionality of Smart Playlists (a feature of XBMC) into the media listings available in XBMC. To take it a step further, the concept is simplified to allow to easily put together a set of properties that a user would like to filter by.
