The aim of this project is implementing pose independent mesh segmentation into CGAL. Basically, the user provides the mesh and number of cluster-labels as input, and gets segmented mesh as output. In segmentation, both volume-based distances of facets and boundary properties of segments will be considered. While calculating volume-based distances, shape-diameter function (SDF) will be used which is invariant under pose changes that makes whole approach 'pose independant'. Sub-parts of this project also incorporates with ray-casting, expectation maximization, and graph-cut algorithms.
