Aeolus is an umbrella project that provides an open source API which can be used to control any number of backend proprietary cloud providers. It allows us to write tooling that can deploy, monitor, and manage OS instances to any cloud provider such as EC2 or OpenStack in a Free and Open Manner. We require more tools to interface with the various Aeolus components from the Fedora desktop (or any other desktop for that matter) in novel ways such as command-line and GTK-based applications to deploy instances to the cheapest cloud provider or the one with the fastest response time, to monitor running instances using various visualizations, and more closely integrate local data and code with that on the cloud.
