In this project I propose to implement a state of the art segmentation approach using graphical models and a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm, which results in faster and better segmentations. Furthermore I propose to create a new pcl package ’pcl_ml’ containing the necessary machine learning techniques such as Markov network structures, inference algorithms and low level functions in a general way such they can be reused for future applications.
