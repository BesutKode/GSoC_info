The goal of this project is to come up with a library for Joomla Platform which will facilitate compressing and combining of JavaScript and CSS files before they are sent to the client browsers. So developers can keep their well structured, commented and easy to read files aside and give compressed files which are optimized for speed downloading, to be served to the end users. And even more they will be able to send a single combined JavaScript/CSS file to render the page instead of sending a number of separate files. So developers will be able to reduce the page download time as well as to save their valuable bandwidth. This will benefit users with faster page loads and webmasters with reduced bandwidth usage.
