Implement autogenerated Colander[0] schema from SQLAlchemy[1] metadata. Main use case is to easily generate forms out of sqlalchemy models keeping in mind the DRY principle. Admin interface for SQL database may not need customization, but in a end-user application developer may need to change any of attributes reflected from sqlalchemy model. Colander design makes it easy to provide such functionality. Needless to say, I will do test-driven development, deliver 100% test coverage and documentation.
