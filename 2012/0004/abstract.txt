There's currently no convenient way to manage services like Redmine, Bugzilla or GitHub issue tracking system in Org-mode. Org-mode already handles TODO-list pretty well, but there's no synchronization functionality for TODO-list services such as Toodledo or Google Tasks. The goal of the project is to let Org-mode import and export to these kind of services in a generic way so that new services can be added easily later on.
