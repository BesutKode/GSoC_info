The Cross Container Support project is aimed to provide management interfaces to manage fully working qemu-user chroot as a normal container. Within this container, the developers could build, compile and test arm targets on faster systems, especially for the targets that do not support cross compilation, like perl and python. Meanwhile, to speed up the build and compile processes, the project also needs to use crossdev-generated gcc against arm-gcc in certain instances. Therefore, parts of gcc toolchain could be switched between native and emulated states inside the chroot.
