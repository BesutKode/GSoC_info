Apache Xerces-J is a high performance, fully compliant XML parser and an XML schema processor which is written in Java[1]. Xerces has more features in it than the requirements of the w3c specification. But, still there are some design limitations which have to be resolved  in its implementation. This project aims one of those design limitations which is “Validating against multiple XML schemas with the same namespace”[2] which will comfort the life of the users.
