During the GeoGebra GSoC project I would like to implement Apps for iPad and Android. One opportunity would be Phone Gap. Itâ€™s an easy way to build applications for mobile devices using HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3. Moreover it allows you to natively target all smartphones with a single codebase.
In my point of view GeoGebra is a very important tool especially for schools, thus I want to contribut to the advancement of GeoGebra and to improve my own knowledge.
