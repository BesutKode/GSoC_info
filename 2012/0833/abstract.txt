My project consists of three parts. The first part of this project adds link tracking between news sites, and the second part adds network visualization and analysis to the media cloud code. After programming these, I will create code allowing for longitudinal analysis of how hyperlink networks predict changes in readership trends of various news sites.  Examining this will allow for descriptive analysis of how html linked networks change, and give insight as to why some blogs and news sites become more popular over time.
