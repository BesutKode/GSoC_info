The PS Move API already offers great cross-platform support for the symbolic inputs as well as the active sensors data (magnetometer, accelerometer and rate sensor) of the PS Move controller. However the PS Move API doesn't support the object tracking capability of the PS Move controller combined with the PS Eye or other cameras. This project aims to fill this gap to provide location tracking for one and two PS Move Controllers. The OpenCV library will be utilized to realize the visual controller tracking. The cross-platform support of the PS Move API is going to be maintained as the OpenCV library itself is available vor multiple platforms.
