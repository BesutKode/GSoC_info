Testing is important part of development. It is a procedure we need to perform many times, that is why there are many tools to automate it. There are cases where it is not that easy, like Visual Verification. Normally we need real person to check whether the web page looks good or not. The goal of this project is to write a tool that allows to easily review set of automatically collected screenshots generated by tests, and also improve existing comparision algorithms.
