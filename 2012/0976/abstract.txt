Pronunciation learning is one of the most important parts for second language acquisition. The aim of this project is to utilize the automatic speech recognition technologies to facilitate spoken language learning. This project will mainly focus on developing accurate and efficient pronunciation evaluation system using CMU Sphinx3 and maximizing the adoption population by implementing mobile apps with our evaluation system. Additionally, we also plan to design and implement game based pronunciation learning to make the learning process much more fun. Four specific sub-tasks are involved in this project, namely, automatic edit distance based grammar generation, exemplar pronunciation database building, Android pronunciation evaluation app interface implementation and game based learning interface development.
