This proposal involves the 'Object Oriented Data Technology' (OODT) and 'Spatial Information Systems' (SIS) projects, both run by the Apache Software Foundation.

The goal of this project is to establish a well-designed, formal, robust connection between OODT and SIS so that data from OODT that is tagged with geographical metadata can be read in and understood by SIS.  This is expected to bring significant benefits to both the OODT and SIS communities.
