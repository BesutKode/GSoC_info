In this Web 2.0 age there are many things that can be done interacting only with a web browser, even learning a programming language. Sites like RubyMonk (http://rubymonk.com/) or Codecademy (http://codecademy.com/) are great starting points for newcomers to a programming language. The goal of this project is to have a site used for anyone who wants to start to learn Smalltalk in an interactive and challenging way. All the progress is tracked and it can be shared to friends across social networks.
