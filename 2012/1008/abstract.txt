This idea wants to solve these two problems in Abiword:
1.	Users can set table attributions(width, height, rotate-angle) preciously in table-setting dialog
2.	Make Frame expandable when users enter extra line of text

I would like to split this idea to two partï¼š
1. Table Setting Dialog: including dimensions setting and 'rotate-angle' setting
2. Frame expandable, making Frame expandable when users enter extra line of text

for the 'rotate-angle' setting issue,  it is another GSOC topic, but if none deal with that, I can do this two topic together.
