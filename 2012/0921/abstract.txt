Develop algorithms and tools for the design and simulation of DSP systems. These tools allow users to develop their own DSP algorithms for speech processing, radar tracking, baseband communications, etc. The blockset should provide capabilities for FFTs, digital filtering, spectral estimation, linear algebra computations, streaming, and multirate processing. The ability to visualize and simulate results with signal generators, interactive scopes, spectrum analyzers, is very interesting for users.
