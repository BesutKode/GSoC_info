Bluetooth connectivity is ubiquitous amongst Android devices, but there are no libraries that handle actual device-to-device communication Android. As a result, klunky calls to the Android SDK libraries are required to use basic Bluetooth communications in a Processing app running on Android. I propose developing a library that, at the very least, streamlines basic serial communication over Bluetooth so it is as easy on Android as it is in a desktop Processing application or on an Arduino device. Time permitting, the library will also be made more robust by implementing methods to use Service Delivery Protocol (SDP) and increase the ease of use for other protocols.
