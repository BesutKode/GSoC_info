I plan to create Registration and Laboratory modules for Raxa. Registration Module is kept on the highest priority which needs to be very user-friendly with easy navigation to make sure fast registration to quickly process long queue of Patients. Though work on Registration has already been started,but lot of work is still pending.  Laboratory Module is another important module with features required in regular Hospital Laboratory.  The project involves working on Sencha ExtJS 4.1 , Sencha Touch 2 , Javascript, MySql and most importantly using REST services of OpenMRS. We are using Jasmine Test for behavior driven testing. Latest deployment can be seen at http://demo.raxa.org/
