The Calligra chart plugin makes it possible to load, display, edit and save charts within Calligra. It can be used in all Calligra applications including Words (the word processor), Tables (the spreadsheet application) and Stage (the presentation application).
While loading and displaying Microsoft Word, Powerpoint and Excel 2000/2003/2007/2010 files and ISO OpenDocument ODT, ODS and ODP files works very well, it is rather bad at saving them back. In lot of cases charts are basically lost after loading+saving a file. The goal of this project is to fix that and improve the current situation.
