The goal of the project is to expand the functionality and to improve the performance of the existing R package 'sdcMicro'.
A major reduction in computation time can be expected from implementing more of the available methods in C/C++ rather than in the high level programming language R.
Furthermore, not all available disclosure methods are yet implemented in R, therefore, it would be of importance to add more methods to the R package 'sdcMicro'.
Thirdly, the methods available in the R package should be easily accessible for subject matter specialists who generally not trained in or used to R or a command line interface.  For this goal, the existing graphical user interface 'sdcMicroGUI' should be expanded to cover most aspects of the process of statistical disclosure control.
