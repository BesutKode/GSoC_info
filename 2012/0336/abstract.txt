CAP is an open format for alerts. Being both machine and human generated and readable and also being widely adapted by government and non-governmental agencies it will be of immense help in building an effective warning system. This project aims to implement CAP capabilities (broadcast and receive) on Eden and provide relevant usable UI components for the viewing, creation and editing of alerts.
