Currently the  KWin zoom plugin and  KMagnifier implement focus tracking using  Kaccessible which only works for Qt/KDE applications. In this project I will change the existing code in the KWin zoom-plugin and KMagnifier to use DBus to connect with AT-SPI2 and fetch needed  information about focused widget. Also I will identify and fix cases where common applications are not sending the focus events and correct accessibility problems in Qt's widgets as they emerge, for example Qt's tree-views.
