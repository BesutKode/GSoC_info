This PDF document describes the project which is going to be implemented during the forthcoming Google Summer of Code 2012. The projectâ€™s goal is to complete the InputAccessLib library, which will allow ease of access to dialog views and pop-ups, thus facilitating the integration of 3rd-party applications with Tecla. The library will also be used to ensure full compatibility with the IRdroid application.
