Melange have extensive set of unit tests but currently it does not have the same coverage for functional tests. Hence there is a need for extensive coverage of  functional tests to make sure that all views work as expected. In order to fill this void. I propose a Data Driven Framework For Functional Testing of  Melange. A test suite consisting of all the possible test cases covering all the possible scenarios of using melange application.
