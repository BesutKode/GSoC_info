Apache Tapestry supplies powerful component structure, and it offered a number of other powerful features that proved to be critical in our work. It allowed a clean separation between Java and HTML, make it possible for the design work on the application to continue well after the code had been completed, and becoming more and more popular today. This project aims to build a lightweight Tapestry visual editor on Eclipse XML editor.
