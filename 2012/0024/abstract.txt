Currently there's no way to define dependencies, organise modules into subfolders or easily submit them to a central repository. With the recent surge in popularity of the composer/packagist pair, I think it would be great to take advantage of this really useful system rather than inventing our own Update the module system to one based on composer/packagist. This would allow module authors to define all the metadata for a module inside a JSON file (tags, requirements etc etc), and all the versioning would be inferred from source control. This means submitting a module would be as easy as submitting the URL to your repository.
