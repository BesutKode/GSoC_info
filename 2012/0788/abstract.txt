This project aims to adding support for WebSockets to ZAP, an intercepting proxy from OWASP. WebSockets are an upcoming standard that can be used for communication between browsers and web servers. The advantages of WebSockets are low overhead and a persistent full duplex channel. To ease development and testing ZAP should support WebSockets. As a result, one can see & even edit messages.
