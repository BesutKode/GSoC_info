Recognizing that a new Scala developer will probably start with a popular and perhaps familiar IDE, I feel that improving the experience with ScalaIDE for Eclipse will benefit not only them but skilled programmers as well. Advanced Scala thinkers using Emacs/Vim likely don't feel an IDE will add a tangible benefit to them, so I hope that improving the Eclipse Scala plugin will increase the value of an IDE for them as well.
