Build a web client to import slides into Connexions and upload them to a service like SlideShare or Google Docs  to render them as embeds. The client should be able to create a module template with introductory paragraphs and should be uploaded to Connexions using the publishing API. Slides should be printable and should be compatible to mobile/tablet views.
