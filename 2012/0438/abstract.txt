LilyPond support for lyrics (words that are sung to the melody) is currently similar to that of the two market leaders (Finale and Sibelius).  I will add advanced lyric positioning functions: syllables will be automatically moved to avoid ambiguities in interpretation and faciliate easier sight reading.  Lyric syllables will no longer cause disturbances in note spacing - instead of moving notes to fit lyrics, lyrics will adapt their position to allow for the optimal note spacing.
