Goal of this project will be do provide aerospace blockset for Xcos. My contribution would focus on allowing users to easily model behavior of spacecrafts: their trajectories, maneuvers and attitude dynamics. To provide a comprehensive and structured set of blocks, block set should contain few essential libraries:

- Guidance, Navigation and Control library 
- Equation of motion library
- Environment conditions library 
- Utilities library
