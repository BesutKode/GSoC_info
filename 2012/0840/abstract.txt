Linux kernel 2.6.32 branch is a major branch which is used by many Linux distributions as a base for their own stable branches.  Hardening RHEL6 kernel with OpenVZ patch is a task which would satisfy the needs of security experienced people.  The task includes porting (almost) all security features from GSoC 2011 Kernel hardening project, both accepted by upstream and NAK'ed because of too specialized usage.
