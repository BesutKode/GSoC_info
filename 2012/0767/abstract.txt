The idea is to create complex image processing chain using the OSSIM python bindings pyossim.  The work will add 'numpy-array' capabilities into pyossim as exchanging formats to include python-gdal and pyOpenCV to solve image processing problems for under water images processing (develop methods for : Bayer Demosaicing, Light detrend, color correction on raw tiff CCD images).

For testing purpose, raw CCD images and relative camera metadata (focal length, distance from the ground, roll, pitch, gain etc..) from the  Habcam project will be used.
