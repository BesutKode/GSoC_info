This project is about creating the fastest parallel GFF3/GTF parser using the low-level next-generation D programming language and an interface plugin for BioRuby. Not only will this become a state-of-the-art fast GFF3/GTF parser, this project will also provide a proof of concept on how to create fast parallelized parser and algorithm implementations, and make them available in higher-level scripting languages. This project will also lay the groundwork for the new BioLib/HPC library.
