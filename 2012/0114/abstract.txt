Meemoo is a Mozilla WebFWD fellow project. It is a framework for hackable web apps by Forrest Oliphant and an incredible tool for web making. My main goal in the project is to extend Meemoo to make modules creation easier. Based on a collaborative live code editor I want to make easy for people to create their new modules for hackable web apps inside their own browsers, without external tools.
