This proposal aims to create a new FOSS educational app for the Tux4Kids family, using the same source for all major desktop and mobile platforms/OS. The application will support learning many subjects through a modular problem generation system, and can serve as the base for new all-platform applications. A unified code-base optimizes development time and lowers the contribution barrier, by removing the need to sync updates between ports or maintain separate bug-fix for different ports.
