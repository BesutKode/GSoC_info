Last GSoC I started a new feature to Shotwell called "Faces tool", which consist in the ability to mark that a certain person is in a certain photo, and where is her/his face â€”i.e. the same you can do, for example, in Facebook. And even my GSoC project was successful, the tool isn't included in Shotwell stable because it lacks some interesting functionality.
