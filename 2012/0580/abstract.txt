This project would produce a replacement for the old "Sky" View of the Reactome Project. Pathways would be represented as Nodes and their relationships (common entities and reactions etc.) would be represented as arcs which would be visualized on a Canvas Interface. It would also show expression and species comparison information in a multi-pathway context, by plotting the output of common proteins on this interface.
