AChecker is an accessibility evaluation tool , which evaluates the accessibility of any URL according to a specific set of international standards. What makes AChecker stand out is its feature to show the likely and potential errors in the URL , where human interventions and decisions are necessary to be made, to decide whether the URL  is accessible enough for the end user. At present , AChecker lists all the warnings( likely and potential errors) and also exports them to the report . The aim of this project is to introduce a feature wherein the end user can evaluate these likely and potential errors  , and declare whether they are "real errors‚Äù dynamically in the report page. These errors will be reflected in the report which will be exported.
