The MAF (Multiple Alignment Format) file format has become popular in
bioinformatics for representing similarities, in the form of sequence
alignments, between multiple whole genomes. Such multiple sequence
alignments enable many kinds of analysis, including examination of the
phylogenetic relationships between organisms, of conserved regions of
DNA potentially indicating functionally important sequences, and
making inferences about genomes by reference to more fully annotated
genomes (Blankenberg et al., 2011). Although BioRuby supports multiple
sequence alignments through the bio-alignment gem, it does not
currently support the MAF format. This project aims to rectify that by
creating a bio-alignment plugin to provide full MAF support from a
native BioRuby interface. This is particularly important as MAF files
can often be in the hundreds of gigabytes and are often queried and
filtered in a rich way; programmatic access to them is valuable for
the same reasons programmatic access to databases is
indispensable. Having native BioRuby support for MAF will thus allow
use of the sizable BioRuby toolset with this data, and also make
BioRuby a more viable tool for an important class of problems.
