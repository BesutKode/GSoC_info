rOpenSci is a collaborative effort to develop R-based tools for facilitating Open Science. Biodiversity occurrence records can be accessed using rOpenSci tools but there is a need to strengthen the functionality, develop visualizations and tutorials for users to learn and make use of the rOpenSci tools. I address this need and also propose a back-end database support to get around memory limits of R while using larger data sets using rOpenSci in this proposal.
