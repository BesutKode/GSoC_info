Aim of the project is to create three parallel versions of OpenPixi (Particles-In-Cell simulator). First, simplest version, should utilize the threads in Java whereas the second a little more complicated but also more powerful version should make use of the computing power of GPU using the OpenCL standard. The final third version should exploit the previous two across several CPUs or GPUs.
