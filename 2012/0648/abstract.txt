The proposed project enables common view of all data in implementations, where multiple OpenMRS instances on different nodes use multiple databases. Each OpenMRS instance with its database can be easily managed. But once multiple databases need to share data to show a common view to all instances, synchronization of data needs to be done. SymmetricDS is a smart, opensource solution to address relational database synchronization bi-directionally, even in resource poor implementation environments.
