During last year's GSoC, a great deal was done to re-integrate the Pootle translation methodology with Sahana Agasti Vesuvius, as well as using Google Translate to translate strings where Pootle translations are unavailable. However, the translation framework needs to be re-calibrated and well-integrated with Vesuvius in order for it to be put to proper use. 
Applying translations to the Resource Page system on Vesuvius needs to be re-thought as well, with some methodology being introduced to apply translations where both the administrators of Vesuvius as well as the users can view them. This project aims to solve both these problems.
