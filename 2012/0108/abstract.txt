This project will be divided into two parts: (1) port the existing 2D Arrangements demo to Qt4, and (2) enhance it by implementing additional features not already demonstrated by the existing demo. The product to be delivered at the end of this project will be a revamped 2D Arrangements demo, with all of the existing features present in a demo making use of the CGAL Qt Graphics View framework, in addition to some new features that flesh out existing, but yet undocumented, code that handles arrangements on surfaces other than a plane.
