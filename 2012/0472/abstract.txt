Overhaul the Applications View: 

Remove mode switch, only leaving windows mode in the overview and making the apps view accessible in a different manner.

Make the apps view paginated, allowing the user to order their apps in pages. The benefit of the pagination over continuous scrolling would be spatial memory of where launchers are.

Add keyboard navigation to windows and apps views. This would increase the speed at which users can traverse these views, and has been a much requested feature.
