I would like to develop a seamless bridge between the language R and Cytoscape. This will allow users of R and Cytoscape to simultaneously work in both programs and utilize their unique strengths: R for analysis and Cytoscape for visualization. The goal is to keep a graph in R in sync with the equivalent graph in Cytoscape and any modifications to the graph itself would be consistent between both programs. This same idea could be further extended to other useful languages such as Matlab.
