This project aims to develop a full featured GUI for visualization and application of the Point Cloud Library's algorithms. Interfaces will be provided for filtering, registration, surface reconstruction, model fitting, and segmentation of point cloud data. The project will leverage the modular nature of the library to create an application which is easy to maintain and extend as the library develops. Optional additional work will look towards developing a "streaming" mode for working with live camera sources, such as those provided using OpenNI.
