SWIG contains experimental support for generating Objective C wrappers (added as part of GSoC 2009), which can be used to make C/C++ objects available to MacOS X applications (and iPhone,iPad) . The Objective C module is mostly functional, but has some rough edges and unimplemented features. The goal of this project is to finish the work done on the gsoc2009-ashishs99 branch and to bring the Objective C module to a state where it can be merged into SWIG trunk.
