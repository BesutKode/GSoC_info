This project will create an open source tool that optimizes component placement on printed circuit boards (PCB) and integrated circuits (IC).  This tool will be integrated into the popular electronic design automation (EDA) tool KiCAD.  The tool created in this project is a new initiative implemented in C that builds upon initial efforts by other contributors implemented in Haskell.
