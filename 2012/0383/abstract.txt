Based on the MOST Java framework an OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Server interface should be implemented. An OPC UA Server toolkit will be provided to simplify implementation. Supporting OPC UA allows various processing (Matlab, Excel, etc.) applications to easily access building data stored with MOST. The OPC UA information model (kind of tree structure to desired information) should be based on the datapoint and zone definitions in the MOST database. For example, the OPC UA “tree” (information model) is build based on zones with datapoints as lead nodes. Methods of the leaf nodes (datapoints) allow data access. The MOST database (datapoints, zones, etc.) is abstracted with a Java framework (DatapointCtrl, ZoneCtrl, etc.). By providing an OPC UA Server toolkit and a Java abstraction layer for building data (datapoints, zones, etc.), implementation is (in the best case) simplified to “connect” building information.
