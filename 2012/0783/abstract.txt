I would be interested in joining the development of the Scala IDE. This project is interesting for me because software testing is a field that I find extremely important. I believe making it easier for developers to create, run, and verify the results of such tests and executable specifications is an essential feature. My goal is to contribute a new plugin which can easily manage tests created by the Specs2 framework, and possibly a simple tutorial about its usage. This is an outstanding possibility I would really like to attend to.
