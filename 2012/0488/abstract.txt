Implementing particle engine in a library-like fashion, using existing game's graphic functionality and SDL library.

Final version of this engine would allow to use it anywhere in map with other drawing functions, given required init is done.

 In addition to simple pixel drawing, I am ready to implement version where small alpha transparent images are blitted for particles. Color transitions for particles wouldn't be a problem either.
