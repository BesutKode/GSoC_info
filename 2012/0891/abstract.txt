This proposal outlines my goals for the FPROPS package for GSOC 2012.
I hope to add new functionality, as well as finish implementation of the EOS
in the pipeline. I will place a strong emphasis on testing and evaluation of
the code to produce a robust, trustworthy product. My educational pursuits
and endeavors are discussed as well as goals and the time line for deliverables.
