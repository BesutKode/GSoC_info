Git uses remote helper to connect to remote repositories to retrieve (fetch) and upload (push) changesets. 
The goal is to create a remote helper that allows those operations on remote subversion (svn) repositories.
To keep the scope adequate I concentrate on importing (fetching) svn revisions. 
The major challenge is mapping svn branches (which are weird to detect) to git branches.
