Tecla Shield allows users to generate switch events which are transmitted using bluetooth.
This events can be translated into the receiving deviceâ€™s events.The main idea of this project is to make a desktop client that will receive the switch events from the Tecla Shield via bluetooth or an android device acting as a mediator in between the Shield and the desktop.Currently switch users rely on expensive dedicated equipment to access the computers.This project will provide a low cost alternative for the same.

The project will mainly contain a cross-platform desktop client mostly written in java with a UI for customizing desktop events and switching events  used to trigger them.It will also contain changes to the existing android application or a new application altogether that will relay switch events to the desktop and additionally the events from android itself. Alternatively the android application would be able to send dictated text from voice actions to the desktop computer as a simpler way to create documents for the switch users.
