This project is about adding an OpenGL ES mode for Marble. Users should be able to choose between the classic software-based rendering mode, which should remain the default for now, and the new OpenGL mode.

The major goal is to get basic features of maps, such as textures, float items and geo-located items, displayed using OpenGL.
