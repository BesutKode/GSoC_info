Any OpenSource Project thrives because of the vibrant community that supports it. The community that we speak of, needs a place to interact, discuss, help each other, and for Sigmah, the Community website project is such a platform. My GSoC Project proposal, talks about some major improvements to the platform, like integration of numerous Wiki like features to the User manual to enhance collaborative contribution, Mailinglists managements for more efficient Inner Governance of the Project, Improvements to the workflow involved in Subscriptions,more efficient integration of the Sigmah Community Platform with the Sigmah Issue Tracker, and addition of numerous other usability features  to the Sigmah Community Platform.
