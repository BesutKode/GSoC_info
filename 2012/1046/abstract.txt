I'm applying the project Port Any Open Source C/C++ Project To The Web. By using the C/C++-to-Javascript compiler Emscripten, I'll port the game SuperTux to the web. SuperTux is a classic 2D jump and run sidescroller game in a style similar to the original Super Mario game. It's written in C++ and released under GNU Public Licence. I'll use Emscripten to build the game and fix any problems along the way (for example to implement missing library functions in Emscripten), and optimize the generated Javascript code to make sure the game running smoothly in browsers. I hope through this project to make Emscripten and the web more fascinating.
