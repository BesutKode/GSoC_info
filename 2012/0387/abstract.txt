Statistical tests for dependence or difference are an important tool in data-analysis.
However, when data is high-dimensional or in non-numerical form (strings, graphs), classical methods fail.
This project implements recently developed kernel-based generalizations of statistical tests, which overcome this issue.
The kernel-two-sample test based on the Maximum-Mean-Discrepancy (MMD) tests whether two sets of samples are from the same or from different distributions.
Related to the kernel-two-sample test is the Hilbert-Schmidt-Independence criterion (HSIC), which tests for statistical dependence between two sets of samples.
Multiple tests based on the MMD and the HSIC are implemented along with a general framework for statistical tests in SHOGUN.
