Scilab is free open source software for numerical computation providing a powerful computing environment for engineering and scientific applications. The current list of distribution functions implemented is very small as compared to that of Matlab. My proposal is to add more Matlab-like pdf's,cdf's,invert cdf's and Rng's. The addition of above Matlab-like features would add more functionalities to the distribution functions toolbox of Scilab.
