The use of statistical inference methods on a set of data provides the most basic analytical intuition of a how the collection of data could be summarized, for instance, a sequential identifier according to a specific order, density among the elements of a particular subgroups, distribution over partitions and so on. These functionalities imply efficiency and reliability on operations performed on large datasets.

Currently, statistical operations on large data sets can be done with SQL instructions, by means of DBMS or some other frameworks based-on SQL sentences; it is done through countless and complicated nested queries, implying performance concerns to non-related users with SQL.

On a high-level layer, it is also possible to have a functional implementation of these statistical operations tightly attached to the performance of each language and to portability concerns among different DBMS.

On an intermediate layer, is also possible to recreate these methods through a sequence of operators on Pig, without being too complex like SQL statements and mainly with the advantage of running over a distributed platform.  On this sense, one feasible improvement on Pig is to provide a set of named operators that implements the statistical inference methods with a standard performance level. 

This improvement becomes a functional integration to experienced users on statistical frameworks, without knowing SQL or any programming techniques.
