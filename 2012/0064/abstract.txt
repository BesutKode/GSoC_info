The proposal aims to develop a gstreamer plugin for robust hand gesture detection and recognition. The proposed plugin will be able to detect and recognise a range of specifically-defined hand gestures in video streams. The plugin will take specific gestures and video streams as input and return matched video streams clips, and, the recognition results may also be outputted as parameters. The interaction part (such like video playing control) will be realised via cooperation with other gstreamer plugins.
