The support for embedding Gecko in applications was dropped by its developers, and that renders the MonoDevelopâ€™s visual editor for HTML/ASP.NET(AspNetEdit) difficult to install, hard to maintain and practically unusable. A port of the editor, which will use WebKit as layout engine will bring new life to AspNetEdit. The main goal of the project is to make the HTML/ASP.NET designer of MonoDevelop userfriendly and easier to maintain.
