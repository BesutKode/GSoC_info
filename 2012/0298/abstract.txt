This project is to develop a benchmark tool
which allows to compare implementations, with different flags and over time
in order to keep track of performance (avoid regression) and detect where it could likely be improved.
It also includes creating a coherent and high quality benchmark suite starting from existing ones.

In particular it would allow to accurately measure JRuby performance
by differentiating early/long-term performance, and the effect of invokedynamic and other external factors.
