Krita is a 2D painting tool, but artists often need to give the illusion of depth. Krita has two tools to help the user draw perspective correctly: the perspective grid and the perspective assistant. The latter is more advanced, but needs improvements to become a real star feature. It needs to be expanded by allowing real 3D objects to be important and put into perspective. This means rotation, setting the vanishing point, scaling, and then integration with the paint tools. At the same time, to get into the codebase, the student should implement other missing features in the perspective assistant.
