Google Android XWiki Connector was the first step for XWiki mobility. Idea is to improve on this to introduce an XWiki mobile Platform where developers can build there own applications on top of it.XWiki Mobile Platform will lie on top of current Google Android XWiki REST connector.We will have the fully functional XWiki mobile blogging application built on top of it. This will feature an android WYSIWYG text editor as a reusable UI element.
