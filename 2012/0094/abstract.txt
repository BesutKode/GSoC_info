In this proposal I want to present myself as a person who can - and want to - contribute to the LibreOffice project. 

I am eager to help and willing to learn. I'm a friendly person and have no problem in listening what person, who knows more, thinks will be better for the project. 

I think the project is great, and the testing is very important in developing and maintaning software.
