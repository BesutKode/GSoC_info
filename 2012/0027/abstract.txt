A major appeal of Software Defined Networking (SDN) is its facilitation of network virtualization. Flowvisor is a specialized OpenFlow controller that serves as a network virtualization layer by acting as a proxy between OpenFlow switches and multiple OpenFlow controllers. Adding Flowvisor's virtualization functions into Floodlight will enhance its capabilities as a controller geared towards both SDN deployment and development.
