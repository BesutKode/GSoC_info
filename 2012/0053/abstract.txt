The goal of this project is implementing a set of standard statistical methods in Orange in its own spirit and style. A lot of code for various statistical methods already exists in Python; we will not reimplement what we can reuse. The bulk of the work will be implementation of widgets and not of statistical computation. It is my hope that the project will encourage others to contribute more widgets of this kind.
