A tool will be developed which can solve cyclic build dependencies using staged build information and then output a build order in which packages have to be built to end up with the desired set of packages. This tool will thus allow the automation of bootstrapping Debian on new architectures. To keep the number of packages that have to be able to be cross compiled small, it will also determine the minimal set of packages that is necessary to switch over to native compilation on the new target. It will also help to check the archive for cyclic build dependencies that can not be resolved by staged build information and gives hints to the developers which packages could be modified to remedy the situation and how.
