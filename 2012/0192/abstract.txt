My proposal for Paper Machines seeks to render visible the hidden connections within a large textual corpus by interweaving and extending pre-existing textual analysis programs and methodologies. I aim not only to produce scripts and visualizations tailored to Dr. Guldi's data set, but also to develop ways of working that will be useful to other scholars (including myself) interested in visualization as an aid to analysis.
