gnulib-tool is the developer tool that collects modules from gnulib and stores them in the source code of a package. It is currently written as a shell script; this leads to limited maintainability and slow execution speed. The task is to rewrite it in Python. This will make the code more maintainable and faster. Required skills: Experience writing code in an object-oriented programming language (such as Java, C#, not necessarily Python). In this project, you can learn Python on the fly or broaden your experience with Python.
