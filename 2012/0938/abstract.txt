New in ODF 1.2 is the ability to annotate parts of the document and the document itself with arbitrary metadata using the W3C RDF standard. I'll design and develop a new feature of the ODF Toolkit library, a new feature of the ODF Toolkit library, which allows to add arbitrary RDF graphs to the document or parts of it, identified by XML file with xml:id, summarized in a manifest.rdf, and to transform ODF XML metadata to RDF metadata.
