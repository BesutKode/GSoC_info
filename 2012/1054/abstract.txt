The ultimate goal of this proposal is to add a mobi ebook-conversion module to the Rhaptos project, so that we can produce beautifully-formatted ebooks on kindle platform and reading applications. I want to modify the existing epub module by writing some scripts to convert the source data to a kindle-friendly format, according to  epub specification, mobi specification and kindle publishing guidelines.
