Currently RBTools consists of a single monolithic script used for interacting with Review Board. Maintaining this script has become difficult, and some effort has been put towards creating a new tool set. This involves the creation of a more “Git like” set of commands, and an improved Python API. Much of the progress has been made by former students, and the code is either incomplete or out of date. I would like to focus cleaning up the command side of the new RBTools, and help in completing the API.
