Graphical Timeline of Events would act as a central backbone to view all the activities going in a browser. Making use of its three components - Content Producers, Data Sink and Graph - it will listen to, collect, and display various browser activities in real time. It is of a great use to any developer as he can view the actual results of his scripts or styles in real time and also view the errors, warning or messages if any. The most important feature of Timeline would be its strong integration with the existing Developer tools and the ability to be set up on a different computer remotely.
