For my project, I propose to implement a collection of puppet modules which correctly deploy an instance of mediawiki with all its dependencies on a server. The target systems for these modules would be Enterprise Linux 6, Ubuntu Precise, and Debian Wheezy. I am planning to achieve this objective by improving upon some of the already existing modules at http://forge.puppetlabs.com rewriting them if necessary.
