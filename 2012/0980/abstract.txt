This project aims to develop an information system for automated kernel crash reports for the FreeBSD operating system. When a FreeBSD system has a crash and responsible is a kernel panic, a crash reporter program will collect some necessary data from the crashed system and deliver them automatically in the form of a report to a central machine. The central machine will receive these reports, check them for validity, store them in a database, recognize which crash reports refer to previously reported bugs, and provide a dynamic website for the presentation of the collected data with different features for the community and the developers of FreeBSD.
