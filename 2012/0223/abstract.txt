Approximate bayesian computing is becoming a more powerful approach for phylogenetic comparative methods. Unfortunately there are no real user friendly open source packages to run this oft-times computationally intensive process. The R package TreEvo hopes to fill this void but there exists a very large amount of code which may or may not function optimally. I propose to go through this code, test and optimize large loops in order to speed upTreEvo's simulation based bayesian architecture.
