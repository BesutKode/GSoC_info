I want to implement parallelization in the Multiple Interacting Instances of Neuronal Dynamics (MIIND) software, to allow the simulation of larger neuron population networks. To achieve this I first want to implement a parallelization on the level of individual neuron populations. As a second step I want to investigate if an additional parallelization on the population algorithm level will bring further benefits.
