The goal of this project is to create an ownCloud application for reading and managing RSS/Atom feeds. As opposed to most of the aggregators existing on the web, the ownCloud aggregator will give the user full ownership and control over the data, which is in the general philosophy of ownCloud. The aggregator will have a web user interface and will integrate with other applications in the ownCloud suite. Moreover, it will provide a web API for synchronization with mobile and standalone desktop feed readers, KDE Akregator above all.
