The user dashboard is the starting point in the review workflow, thus its purpose should be to present as much relevant information and allow to the user to prioritize and easily navigate to the requests he finds most interesting. Currently, the dashboard is composed of a request table, the only available information, besides the summary, being available as custom columns with binary data (has/hasn’t received a ShipIt, has/hasn’t been commented). My proposal is to add a new view to the dashboard which displays the latest changes to any requests considered interesting by the user as an action feed.
