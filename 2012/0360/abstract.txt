The main goal of this project is upgrade the UI from its current look to a look that is more reflective of the black, white and grey colour set used throughout GNOME. This will not only create a unified experience throughout GNOME, but will make it much more pleasant for a user to use.  the base code from the original Fortran translated coding into one that has the various bugs fixed and at the same time changes the UI to one that reflects a more elegant and appealing UI. This is especially important for users to continue to use this application and not abandon it for a potentially better application that may be out there.  For the UI change, I will take inspiration from this page: https://live.gnome.org/Design/Apps/Calculator where  there is already an image showing the relevant art and the ideal new UI for the application. In addition to this UI change, an optional goal would be to redo the base Fortran translated code by taking inspiratio from the bugs that are mentioned here: https://bugzilla.gnome.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=product%3A%22gcalctool%22+
and the idea is that by fixing these bugs and changing the UI, there will be a dramatic usability increase. Finally, C and GTK+ will be used to do this from a coding perspective.
