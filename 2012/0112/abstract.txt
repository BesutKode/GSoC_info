The goal of this project is to provide a HTML/CSS-visualizer for the K framework. This would allow to quickly view an elegant summary of any programming language described using K. In the current version of K, this is achieved by compiling the definition using Latex. Creating a webpage rather than using Latex should greatly speed up the creation of the visual representation. The HTML would be generated in Java from the XML-like structures produced by the K tools.  Using Javascipt and/or PHP, it would be possible to make the visual representation interactive by offering editing features. Ultimately, this project could be used as debugger. The fast generation of the webpage would allow a developer to directly examine and fix the result of his work in a browser.
