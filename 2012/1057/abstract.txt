This module allows users to personalize their content easily. Users define audience types with DSL and users can use audience types in the template to personalize their content. Users can define audience type by location, in-bound keyword, in-site activity(keyword search, history), os, browser, device, etc. As far as I know, this module would become the first module that provides content personalization and targeting feature for a major CMS.
