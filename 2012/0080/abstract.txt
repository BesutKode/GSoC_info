The project aims to redesign the AChecker interface from scratch. The new design will be much more user-appealing, providing dynamic access to the various functionalities of the AChecker.
The new interface will be compliant with W3C WAI ARIA specification which will guarantee system accessibility.
Once the design is finalised, it will be developed using PHP and AJAX technologies with JQuery and XML.
