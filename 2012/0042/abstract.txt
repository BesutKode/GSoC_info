The aim of the project is to provide a port of Wiselib to OpenWrt (a Linux based distribution for routers) as well as WiFi Radio & Neighborhood support. Historically open source projects have gained a lot from hobbyists and casual contributors looking for scratching a particular itch. Making the technology available on a popular platform among hackers will be a boon for the entire Wiselib community. One particular benefit would be for people to start experimenting with ideas such as “intelligent home”. With the WiFi Radio & Neighborhood support as well we can take this one step further and make it possible for average people or developers to use/improve/provide feedback to technologies developed by academia.
