Improve Marble's OpenStreetMap data support by making it able to read from raw .osm data and render it in vectors. 

The main problems that will have to be faced are developing a new tilling scheme for managing large data amount queries, extract relevant information depending on the zoom level and match the actual Marble's zoom leves with OpenStreetMap's stepped zoom.
