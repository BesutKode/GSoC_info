The main aim of the project is to create SBGN (Systems Biology Graphical Notation) compliant views for the networks used to visualize cancer maps  at “cBio Cancer Genomics Portal” . The project requires customization of Cytoscape Web that already used for network tab at  “cBio Cancer Genomics Portal” [2]. I plan to do this work in two stages. First, create a Cytoscape Web based viewer for biological networks using SBGN Process Description notation. Then, customize this component for cBio Cancer Genomics portal so as to overlay genomics data onto such network views. Thus the hope is for the former component to be reusable in other projects.
