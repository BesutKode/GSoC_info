The Pathway-Comparison-plugin will load two pathways and compare them in PathVisio on the basis of Data Nodes and their interactions.

The user selects two pathways and hits the "Compare" button.The differences (which are actually the common nodes/interactions) between the 2 pathways are then listed in a Difference Viewer panel. Besides the list of differences, the Difference viewer will also have the 2 pathways loaded up and displayed side by side. The user could then select a difference from the list and this will be highlighted in both pathways.
