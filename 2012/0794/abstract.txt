Create and measure the performance of an automatic pronunciation evaluation system based on Sphinx3 which will detect mispronunciations at the phoneme level and provide feedback scores and learner adaptation with phoneme, biphone, word, and phrase scores based on standardized phoneme acoustic scores and durations, edit distance scoring using alternate pronunciation grammars, and, if time permits, articulation-based phonological features.
