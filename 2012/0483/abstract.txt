Currently sphinx4 uses a predefined dictionary for mapping words to sequence of phonemes. I propose modifications in the sphinx4 code that will enable it to use trained models (through some king of machine learning algorithm) to map letters to phonemes and thus map words to sequence of phonemes without the need of a predefined dictionary. A dictionary will be only used to train the required models.
