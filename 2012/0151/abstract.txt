Demand for Wireless technologies has increased over the years, thus mobile devices have become a general necessity for everyday life. In order to provide more realistic simulation of wireless networks there is a need for developers to create a mechanism of simulating movements of wireless (mobile) users. These mechanisms are called mobility models. In my project I will program (implement) the most common mobility models into the Java open-source code. Furthermore, mobile nodes can often fail while present in mobile system. The goal of this project is to build fully controllable environment with ability to simulate both mobility models and failures of the nodes.
