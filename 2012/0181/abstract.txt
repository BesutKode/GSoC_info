The goal of this project is to design a modern and portable SOCR web-app that demonstrates the concepts of statistical analysis such as resampling, randomization and probabilistic simulation and runs seamlessly across varied devices. The application will be based on HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript framework. Currently the tools available for statistical simulations are built on clunky and require the browser to be java enabled.
