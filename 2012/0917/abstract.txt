Amarok can maintain useful per-track play statistics and meta-data such as: 
play count, first/last played date, rating and labels; these are tracked for 
each collection separately. This project will implement statistics 
synchronization between all collections that support them (local, iPod) in its 
first part. Second part is to implement synchronization of the statistics from 
scrobbling services such as Last.fm to Amarok. (other way around already 
partially works)
