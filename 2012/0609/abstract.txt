Currently, James mailbox supports email indexing over Lucene, the directory implementation of the Lucene search and indexing relies on relational databases, or file-system storing. As the number of indexes increases with the number of clients using the mailbox so does the performance of the indexing degrade, thus an implementation over a noSQL database like HBase would solve this problem by distributing the indexes and documents on a system designed for high amounts of data.
