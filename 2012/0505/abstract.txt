Recently open sourced gem twitter-cldr-rb is a good starting point for developing a library that'll bring reach internationalization and localization capabilities to Ruby language. Though, at this point the gem lacks several features that would be very useful for localization software. These features include full support of pluralization rules, text normalization, strings sorting, etc. My goal during Google Summer of Code will be to make these capabilities available to the Ruby community by implementing them (at least a substantial number of them) as a part of twitter-cldr-rb gem.
