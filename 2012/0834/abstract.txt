So far, libgit2 supports fetching objects over http://, git:// and file://. This year's GSoC task is to finish network support for libgit2, namely

* fetch over ssh (including an API for SSH key management),
* support for packing objects (indispensable for push),
* push over http, git and ssh.

The existing network code is written in a modular manner and allows to be reused (regarding socket handling for example).
