TranslateSvg has the potential to revolutionise the ability of Wikimedia's diverse groups of image maintainers to work together on the same communal set of SVG images. At the moment, providing alternative translations of SVG files typically requires "forking" the image. This drastically increases the image's maintenance burden and discourages image improvement. TranslateSvg would completely change this suboptimal workflow by allowing translations to be embedded within a single image file.
