Build Feature/Object Based Image analysis tools for Opticks. These tools will partition remote sensing (RS) imagery into meaningful image-objects, and assess their characteristics through spatial, spectral and temporal scale.
At its most fundamental level, OBIA(object based image analysis) requires image segmentation, attribution, classification and the ability to query and link individual objects in space and time.
