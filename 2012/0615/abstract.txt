Apache Airavata provides capabilities to construct, execute and monitor computational workflows with built in support for executing compute intensive applications on grid computing resources and cloud resources. This project aims to implement support for cloud(grid) bursting to compute intensive Hadoop jobs. Migration of partially completed Hadoop jobs to/from cloud(grids) from/to local cluster will also be implemented as part of the project.
