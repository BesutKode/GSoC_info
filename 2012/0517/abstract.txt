I would like to work on Entity disambiguation in Stanbol. Suppose I have "George Bush" in a sentence or document.

 There are may be two matches.
 1. George H. W. Bush - 41st US President
 2. George W. Bush â€“ 43rd US President. 

The idea is to provide support to Stanbol enhancer to be able to disambiguate between 1 and 2 on the basis of context from the document and data associated with 1 and 2.
