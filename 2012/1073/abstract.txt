This project is part of the effort to reduce the overhead in supporting Ruby on Fedora and to promote Fedora as the de-facto platform for Ruby development. The Fedora/Ruby community works hard to convert the Ruby gems into rpms for inclusion in the Fedora stack. I will develop a website (isitfedoraruby.com) to promote such effort, highlight success stories, use cases, ways to help, etc.
