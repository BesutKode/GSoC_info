The technology evolved since the time AChat was developed. The WAI-ARIA standard, developed by W3C, introduced new notion of live regions that make web content more accessible for people with disabilities. The goal of this project is to make a new accessible chat with WAI-ARIA live regions extending the one already created by more efficient data transfer, larger feature set and intuitive interface.
