Stellarium OpenGL code is all over the place
and not very maintainable.

The goal of this project is to isolate the OpenGL code
into a separate subsystem that will be usable through
a backend-independent API, so in future, backends for
other OpenGL versions or even non-OpenGL backends could be created.
