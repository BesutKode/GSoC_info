The proposal is aimed at majorly 2 things.
Firstly, making Irdroid and Google Remote TV(bonus project) tecla accessible.
Secondly, incorporating the ideas of Google Tap in order to  take Morse code as an input technique.
If the remaining time permits, I intend to extend the functionality of Tecla Access by making it able to control desktop computers.
