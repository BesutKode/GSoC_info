The goal of this project is adding TLS (HTTPS and FTPS) support to net/tnftp and NetBSD base ftp program. Growing number of Internet sites that use HTTPS, and software development communities around such sites (e.g. GitHub) demands, consequently, support for fetching files via HTTPS. I plan to use the SSL/TLS implementation in OpenSSL, and to introduce a build option to disable TLS support, in that case OpenSSL is not be required as a dependency.
