It is important to load images or other files (such as Excel spreadsheets generated during EBRT - External Beam radiation Therapy or Brachytherapy based Oncology treatments) with patients clinical record.
 We are proposing this project so that, the implementers while developing the HTML Forms using the HTMLForm entry module can provide a file upload button to the data entry user. Consequently, when the user load a file/image while doing data entry for an encounter, those files should be stored in the server so that they are available to be viewed/downloaded by other users.
