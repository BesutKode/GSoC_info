Open Monitor Desktop Agent, a graphical network connectivity detector robot written and used in python, currently has some bugs need to be fixed, some new features could be developed and some language should be added. My proposal is to finish Open Monitor Desktop Agent integration including the IPv6 Support, fix bugs , add some new features like enhancement in Login window, as well as some new functions such as status of the connectivity, P2P information and so on. Then, a series of tests like connectivity testing, scheduling testing, real-world simulation testing, graphic UI testing etc. in different platforms should be performed to make a release including Chinese and Japanese UI version. Finally, the technical documents and manual should be developed.
