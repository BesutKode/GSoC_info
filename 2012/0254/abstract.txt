Scoutess is a tool for package maintainers and automates a lot of the hassle of dealing with dependencies and multiple versions of libraries. It will create a sandboxed environment simulating a fresh Haskell Platform install, attempt to build your project using Cabal and highlight any problems while also tracking changes or updates to dependencies located in remote repositories so these can be tested against as well.
