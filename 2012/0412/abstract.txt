The aim is to implement tools for structured output (SO) problems. The data in these problems have complex structure (e.g. graphs, sequences) and the traditional learning algorithms fail to find solutions efficiently. Structured output support vector machines and conditional random fields are methods for SO learning. They will be implemented to form Shogun's first module for SO learning. Finally, these methods will be applied to hidden Markov models-type of problems such as gene prediction.
