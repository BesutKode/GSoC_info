This project aims to create a roster tool for the CERT service. This would involve a web interface where one could view time scheduling of volunteers. Volunteers could be reassigned using drag and drop features on the timetable as per need and requirement. The interface will highlight empty slots which require filling to the user. The client may then choose to fill these slots manually or take advantage of the autofill functionality of the application which will fill the slots for you.
