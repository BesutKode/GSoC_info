As stated above I will be creating an end-user defined, dynamic rank structure within the guild manager. The Guild manager already has a Grade system (Member, Bearer, Recruiter, Officer, High Officer and Guild Leader) and each grade has their own permission. One thing it doesn't have is the ability for a Guild Leader to define his own hierarchy  based on ranks he/she would like to use (e.g. Soldier, Sergeant, Lieutenant). I feel this addition will add depth to the multi-player community that cannot be experienced without it.
