Statsmodels is a pure Python-based statistics and econometrics package 
that has drawn significant attention from applied practitioners from 
the fields of Finance, Economics and social sciences. Many of the 
basic econometric methods have been developed. In addition some 
impressive work has been done in developing the time series methods, 
VARs, and DSGE models to name a few. This GSoC I intend to develop the 
nonparametric capabilities of statsmodels by focusing in particular on 
data-driven bandwidth selection procedures, conditional and 
unconditional multivariate probability and cumulative density 
estimation and implementing popular nonparametric and semiparametric 
regression models.
