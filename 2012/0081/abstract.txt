The input for the voxelize command is going to be geometrical data. The output is a set of voxels which can be used to represent the input accurately enough so that it can be used for fluid dynamics and volume rendering work. The raytracing algorithm has to be implemented for the purpose of producing a set of arb8's that approximate the input accurately for the desired purpose.

Finally, TCL binding has to be provided to connect mged editor to the functionality provided by the voxelize command.
