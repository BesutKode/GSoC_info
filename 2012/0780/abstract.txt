Observing, analyzing and interpreting flow of reactions and interactions among proteins, genes and other biochemical compounds is of utmost importance today. In order to make the work of researchers and biologists simple and efficient, a quick, precise glance of the chain of reactions to/from/between two entities (proteins/ genes etc.) is required. With networks today containing more than 10,000 nodes and 20,000 edges, it is virtually impossible to follow up on dependencies without an easy-to-use tool to help you out!
