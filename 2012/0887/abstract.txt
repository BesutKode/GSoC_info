Currently Calligra Words can add/remove citations and bibliographies. But it doesn't store citations for future use and doesn't have any interface for bibliography engines. The aim of this project is to provide a user interface which will let the users manage and organize citation database and to provide an interface for bibliography engines which allows them to insert citation and bibliography in Words.
