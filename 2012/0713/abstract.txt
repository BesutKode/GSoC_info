Project's goal is to create set of elements to manage waveform reading and display in various Gstreamer based applications. Currently it is done individually on per application basis (with none of implemetations convicingly being more superior than others), and developers are looking for common set of software to address this. Also several new applications are expressed desire of waveform functionality if such set is produced. It would also consolidate current efforts and give one shared code base to optimise and extend.
