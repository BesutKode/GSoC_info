At present the content of modules and widgets download pages are not well maintained on community website of SilverStripe. Search form gives very few options. For submitting or updating any new module users need to fill a form. In the proposed version of system, users can simply submit URL of their module repository and the files would be fetched automatically. In this project Also we have to redesign search and detailed pages of module/widgets.
