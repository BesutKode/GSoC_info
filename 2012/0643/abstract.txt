In-page l10n tool will allow making translations of OpenMRS right when viewing web page. For now, itâ€™s annoying for developers to make number of steps to provide even a default translation of a text message within OpenMRS. In addition, actual translators also need to complete a lot of actions to provide further translation. Obviously, it makes translations process inconvenient and not efficient. So, the main goal of this project is to implement and integrate pretty handy tool for in-page l10n.
