The goal of this project is to create a central repository of metadata where OpenMRS installations can publish their metadata. The Metadata Sharing Server will store metadata from different OpenMRS servers and expose them to clients. Clients will be able to search through metadata packages and choose some to import and subscribe. In this model the Metadata Sharing Server will act as a central subscription server for clients.
