UPnP is a standard which allows discovery of and access to media contents in a home network. It is supported by many modern TVs and media receivers. With large collections of digital photos presentation on a TV is a natural solution but is not easily possible at the moment. This project will implement an inbuilt plugin in digiKam, which will let the user export her images on her home network and visible on all DLNA compliant devices.
