This project aims to implement the Gephi Graph Streaming API by interconnecting GraphStream’s dynamic graph event model with Gephi so as to have Gephi visualize ongoing graph evolutions and measurements. This proposal gives an introduction of GraphStream’s dynamic graph event model and Gephi’s support for dynamic graph. Then a method based on the source, sink and pipe model in GraphStream is provided for integrating GraphStream with Gephi. At last, the time line and milestones are listed.
