The purpose of the project is to create a specialized Git merge driver for plain text Org-Mode formatted files.  A merge driver is a program which will combine two versions of a file based off of a common ancestor into a single file, marking conflicting changes within.  A specialized merge driver for Org-Mode files will be able to leverage the structure to understand the effects of modifications on the integrity of sections.  The merge driver will solidify Org-Mode as a tool for collaborative work.
