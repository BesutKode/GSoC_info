Fuel is a general purpose binary serializer. It already saves and loads classes without using a compiler. Package management has additional challenges like check dependencies, run pre- and post-scripts, override existing classes or methods, tolerate superclass shape changes, run system validations, send notifications, clean uninstall, and others. Provide integration with current tools like Monticello, Gofer and Metacello would be good.
