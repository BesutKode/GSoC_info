Computational Photography is an exciting new area at the intersection of Computer Graphics and Computer Vision. Through the use of computation, its goal is to move beyond the limitations of conventional photography to produce enhanced and novel imagery of the world around us. Computational photography refers broadly to computational imaging techniques that enhance or extend the capabilities of digital photography. The output of these techniques is an ordinary photograph, but one that could not have been taken by a traditional camera.
