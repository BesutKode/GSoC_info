Lately, mobile devices with cameras have become very powerful. Interesting applications of Computer Vision, Augmented Reality and Graphics become increasingly feasible. Examples include Image Stitching, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping, Barcode Scanning, Marker-based or Marker-less Tracking, Optical Character Recognition and Super Resolution. I would like to help out creating examples for the benefit of the community with my skills in iPhone programming. Also I want to learn about Android.
