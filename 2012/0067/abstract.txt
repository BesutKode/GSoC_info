The aim of this project is to fully flesh out the existing Python interface and extend it to completion, with special focus on finishing the API for basic game manipulation operations and wrapping the remaining more complex features that are already supported in C++, e.g. representation and manipulation of mixed and behavior strategies. A full test suite will also be written to check  correctness and proper handling of error conditions.
