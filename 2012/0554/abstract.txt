Deploying SOS on a server is quite a complex process as of now. Also, data administration tasks such as Read/Update/Delete operations on database and changing configuration settings is not very user friendly. After this project has been completed, SOS will have a web-based user friendly automatic installer and a SOS administration, which will make configuring SOS very easy and intuitive and all data administrative tasks could be done at one place.
