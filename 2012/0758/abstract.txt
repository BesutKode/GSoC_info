This project aims to develop an algorithm that maps IP addresses of CERN VM clients to mirror servers in such a way that network latency is reduced. The project also involves building a web application to allow administrators to dynamically add/remove mirror servers. Also, the application should allow for visualization of mirror locations across the globe on a Google/OpenStreet map.
