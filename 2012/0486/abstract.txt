Today, displays have been evolving on an exponential scale. From 320-1366px, there is a sundry of displays to view websites from. The goal of this project is to make XWiki accessible across all screens by manipulating size and layout of the design to best fit the context. Responsive design have the advantage of matching every size because of its fluid nature (% based), and is thus more feasible than creating specific size targets (which Responsive design still include), which changes too often.
