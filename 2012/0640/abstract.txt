The project deals with developing interfaces for High Level Architecture (HLA) for ns-3 project and thus enabling it to participate in a distributed simulation (Federation) involving various federates over Run Time infrastructure (RTI). The project involves three phases. Firstly, creating a Federate and Federate Ambassador for ns-3 to communicate with the RTI. Secondly, creating a synchroniser and simulator implementation that uses time from the RTI clock. Finally, creating a helper classes and modules to simplify the process of sharing and using objects in a distributed simulation.
