Short task list:
- Add next slow formats to JtR
--WPA-PSK (CUDA/OpenCL/CPU)
--Mac OS X password hashes (10.7 and 10.8)
--DES-based crypt(3) or FileVault 
- Optimize existing formats 
Aim for oclhashcat performance, It should be possible for all formats except sha*-based crypt.I would like to make them 80%+ faster.
- Develop optimal thread/blocks finder for cuda patches
- Try multigpu with MPI
- Create auto-benchmarking tool for different pass/salt length
