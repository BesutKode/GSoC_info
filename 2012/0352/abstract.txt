Currently everyone using Overtone must setup a clojure environment and editor, but it would be great if people who are unfamiliar with software development and/or clojure (e.g. musicians, artists, etc...) could download a single application to easily experiment with pre-existing instruments, sequencers, samplers, fx-racks made for guitars or other external instruments, etc.  The app would let someone browse a built-in library of examples, evaluate code, experiment in a repl, open and save text files.  The processing.org or SuperCollider applications are examples of this kind of system.
