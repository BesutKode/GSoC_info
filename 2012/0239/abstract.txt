The XMPP PubSub architecture is an excellent choice for microblogging-like functionality such as buddycloud's “channels”, but unfortunately it is currently difficult to integrate into the HTTP-centered social web. This project aims to achieve the design and implementation of a bridging server that can expose XMPP PubSub nodes as HTTP resources, using standards such as Atom and PubSubHubbub, to provide interoperability between PubSub and the web.
