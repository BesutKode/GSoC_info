LLVM already contains a profiling framework, but only a handful of transforms make use of the metadata.  Further, it even contains a path profiling framework, but no transforms make use of it.  This "Google Summer of Code" proposal lays out an achievable plan to enhance profiling in LLVM and to use profiling metadata in key transformations where it can have a strong positive effect.
