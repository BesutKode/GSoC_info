Android platform is now a focus of attackers and security researchers. It’s very essential to provide a convenient and multi-functional tool to detect and analyze the malware. I’d like to improve the APKInsepctor with improvement of UI and adding of more features to assist the analysis of malware. The new version of APKinspector will be a powerful tool with multiple security functions such as permission analysis and static analysis as well as a user-friendly tool with convenient GUI and easy-to-use configuration. The planned new feature includes but not limited to fine-grained CFG, permission analysis model, call graph, data flow analysis and repackaging.
