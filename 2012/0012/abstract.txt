Weave is an open-source web-based visualization system.  To provide a responsive interface while visualizing large data sets (300,000 records), some form of threading must be developed for the single-threaded ActionScript environment.  Once we have that, the rendering code must be refactored to be asynchronous with double-buffering to provide the user with a responsive and usable interface.
