The goal of this project is to extend biographer to support the simulation and analysis of boolean networks. The project involves writing modules for importing models in booleannet format and also automatically generating models for a reaction graph. An interface needs to be then provided for simulating the boolean network step by step using Biographer's existing UI. Simple tools that calculate the steady state, trajectory length and cyclic attractors will also be written
