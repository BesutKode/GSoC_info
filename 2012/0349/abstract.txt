Nowadays many people are talking about the "Internet of things". This theory is based on a lot of Machine to Machine communication over the IP network. Because of the large amount of sensors, it definitely requires the large IPv6 address space. I would implement the 6LoWPAN stack as a type of a radio, because this way the algorithms don't have to be modified. I want to use the Contiki operation system's implementation, the uIPv6 and the slip (Serial Line IP) as a baseline for my project.
