Extend ATutor content integration capabilities to present content that exists in AContent. This will allow instructors to search through the AContent elearning content repository. Instead of downloading or importing content for their courses, they can simply create a link within their ATutor content and have AContent content display as if it were part of ATutor content. This will allow content to be updated in AContent and propagate through all courses in ATutor that have that content linked in.
