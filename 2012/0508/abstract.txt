This specific project entails implementing a set of tags for HTML Form Entry to allow form designers to have widgets that allow the input of dynamic lists, where clinicians can add and remove items for fields on a patients form.  This project will require designing and implementing the HTML tags and backend to create these dyanmic list widgets, and creating some real life example forms that use the new functionality.
