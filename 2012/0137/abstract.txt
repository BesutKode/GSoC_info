Project’s main idea is to implement the Sling support for Apache Airavata. Currently Airavata API is used to store/retrieve data from Jackrabbit content repository. But it’s not scalable when comes to handle large amount of data, because of keeping the session in the client side. Sling supports accessing Jackrabbit in RESTfull way. So the basic requirement is to come up with another API which looks like the current API, but uses jackrabbit through Sling Interface.
