Through this work a framework will be developed to link the inherent structures in DeSTIN and OpenCog to provide cognitive synergy between the two systems.  Eventually this framework will allow the learned objects DeSTIN creates to be represented as OpenCog nodes, and the ability for learned nodes in OpenCog to influence the probabilities in the DeSTIN nodes leading to improved cognition.
