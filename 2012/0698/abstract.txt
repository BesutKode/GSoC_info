My proposal is developing a desktop application to manage CNML files. It will be useful for people that administer zones, workers that install Guifi.net nodes... etc.

CNML files offer a lot of possibilities that are not being exploited actually. It can also be used for statistics, data visualization, which will help people in their studies, or thesis about libre networks.

This application will load a CNML file and show its contents in friendly windows. Users will be able to filter nodes or zones by name, coordinates or hardware used.
