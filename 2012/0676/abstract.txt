The ODF Command Line Tools (OCLT) would purport to be a suite of
cross-platform utilities that would make it easy to do both simple and
complex text manipulation tasks from the command line.  The OCLT would
be able to manipulate ODF documents both in terms of structure *and*
content.  The target audience of the OCLT would be command-line afficionados,
power users, QA testers, web developers, and others who may be, but are
not necessarily, professional developers.
