Currently, systers code is available as a branch form in repo. To use it, one needs to install mailman, and then checkout the systers code, and edit configuration files to make it working. The idea of the project is to move from brach form to patch form, which will make it easy for installation and testing across different platforms. Additionally, most of testing is done manually. This project involves working to automate everything from patch creation for new releases to testing to release management.
