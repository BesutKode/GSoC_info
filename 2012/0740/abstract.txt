e_cidadania is at a very nascent stage and it has undergone only a year of development. At this very stage, it is necessary to adopt development practices which will make the project bug-free and maintain and improve code quality. The project aims to use tools such as nose and webtest for unit and functional testing, zc.buildout for assembling, development and deployment and configuring pylint to test if the codebase follows PEP 8 standards.
