I am Mayte Gim√©nez, and I am a last year student of computer science at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. I worked for Sakai for the last 3 years, always with scholarships.I began a cross platform application for Sakai last GSoC, and I would love finish the applications. A native application has a lot of advantages for education institutions.
