Dynamic report generation can rescue us from repetitive and unnecessary manual tasks. In our project, we will extend the knitr package for better applications in the web so that web pages can be easily compiled with R like Sweave documents. The knitr package is a general-purpose tool for dynamic report generation; the basic idea is like Sweave: we only write source code in a document mixed with normal texts, then use a tool to evaluate the code to get output, so that we do not need to copy and paste results from the computing engine to the output document. Knitr comes with a flexible design and can be extended to multiple output formats via output hooks.  In this project, we will enhance HTML features of knitr package, including code highlighting, animation support, markdown conversion and integration with website-building tools.
