CERN’s CernVM Co-Pilot is a framework that allows computer users to participate in CERN’s volunteer computing cloud for calculating resource-intensive experiments. The downloading, computing, and uploading of experiments is done by the Co-Pilot Agent software, which users install on their home computers. I propose to port this Co-Pilot Agent to iOS, which would allow CERN to utilize the computing resources of thousands of mobile phones across the globe for the computation of experiments.
