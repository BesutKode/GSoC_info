Realtime collaboration on Visual Editor would allow Visual Editor to be used much like Etherpad, Google Wave, and similar other collaborative editors.

This project aims at implementing Phase 1 of the Realtime Collaboration project whose features would be - 

(1) Allow single editor in an editing session, others can spectate changes made in realtime.
(2) The editing control can be passed over to another client by the current editor.
(3) Provide codebase for extending with Phase 2 features; Multiple editors, and concurrency control.
