Analysis of dynamical information on gene expression is become of increasing interest for the scientific community, and the development of open source tools to provide the ability of analyzing such datasets is highly required. Cytoscape offers an ideal and already well developed framework into which network structured data can be accessed, visualized, and analyzed. I propose the implementation of a computational efficient (event-based) implementation for the loading and visualization of dynamical networks. Moreover I'll test the implementation, on the visualization of dynamical differences between a test control case and a network perturbation case.
