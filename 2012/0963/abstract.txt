Nomacs is an open source image viewing and editing software. The two things that distinguish Nomacs from other image viewer are the synchronization and wide range of image formats it supports. Nomacs supports raw files that are becoming more and more popular between photographers because of the editing freedom they give us. There are very few open source applications that allow us raw image editing. The main goals of my project would be to update the current process of displaying raw pictures, so it would produce a better image and to add new image editing functions, mainly for raw files.
