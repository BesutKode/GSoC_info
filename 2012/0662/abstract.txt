Current VFS implementation is concentrated in one monolithic class. VFSv2 is a modular redesign of VFS that separates actual file manipulation from main iVFS interface. Using new iFileSystem interfaces, the redesign will allow extending VFS backends with SFC plugins, and introduce new features like large file support, moving files, file permissions, and possibly plugins for additional backends.
