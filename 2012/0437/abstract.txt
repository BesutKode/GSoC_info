People wish to have a tool to export images as video slideshow.
This is what tools like man2dvd,imagination, image2mpeg does, or we can use command line tools of imageMagick
and mjpegtools to export images as video slideshow with required transitions. However 
the powerfullness of these tools come at a price: complexity. The goal of this project
is a develop a kipi frontend tool using these tools(imageMagick and mjpegtools) to 
export images as videoslideshow. This must be able to do authoring with image contents,
for example to change order of images, slide time pause, add transition effects, add
audio files as a background. This tool must be able to export to video files, as MPEG, AVI
DIVX, or to video media, as CD and DVD video. The tool must be portable under Linux, MacOSX
and windows.
