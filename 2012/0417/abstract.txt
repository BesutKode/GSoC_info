Mayhem is a simple scripting system that includes a library of events and reactions that can be trivially connected together. My project consists of adding 4 new modules to Mayhem: Microsoft Office Module, Google Module, Connectivity Module, Skype Module. By adding new capabilities to the program, my project intends to give users the opportunity to connect the features of their programs and devices in the most useful, effective and fun way.
