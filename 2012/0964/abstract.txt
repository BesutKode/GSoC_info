Inclusive Design Institute is an organization that seeks to make the open web truly "Open".  My selected project will help further the goal of an accessible internet.  My proposal takes this a step further by making development of the web accessible to people of any situation.  Decoupling the design and programming process from the absolute need of a keyboard and mouse.  This GSoC project will aim to lay the groundwork for a downloadable web-app that removes the text-based editing of HTML & CSS, by translating the language to a more visual drag-and-drop or speech driven environment.
