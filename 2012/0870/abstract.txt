The project titled “GIS link to the Web of Things” envisions a world in which everyday devices and objects are linked by fully integrating them into the World Wide Web. Imagine, a scenario in which thousands of sensors spread over the seven seas can be controlled via any location on the earth. Although, one would rightly argue that such system are already in place, but what we are lacking is an interoperable API which can answer http request to the sensors, and its equivalent GIS software at the client/access end. Implementing the GeoServices REST API directly on the sensor platform would provide just that.
