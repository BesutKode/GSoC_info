Lattices arise in many different areas of mathematics such as algebra, geometry, cryptography, and coding theory, so it would be good to have important lattice algorithms implemented in one place in Sage and a framework to implement new algorithms. The goal of this project is to create a lattice class that includes various algorithms for problems such as finding a good base, finding shortest vectors, calculating lattice invariants, and calculating the Voronoi cell of a lattice.
