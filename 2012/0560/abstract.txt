Core idea of the project is implementing a library of built-in integration patterns for Synapse. The Enterprise Integration Patterns are well defined solutions to recurring problems within a given SOA or ESB or Web Service development. Each pattern is defined as a framework for designing, building messaging and integration systems as well as a common language for  architecting solutions. So the purpose of project is to strengthen Apache Synapse to support most of the Enterprise Integration Patterns from the book by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf .
