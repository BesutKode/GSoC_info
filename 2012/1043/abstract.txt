This project aims to make it possible to use moin2 as a simple but usable issue tracker. It will utilize and possibly extend moin2's abilities of metadata handling, searching and indexing. Flatland will be employed extensively to handle the rendering and editing of metadata in a consistent and elegant way. All of the development work will be done as reusably as possible, so that other components of moin2 (instead of just the issue tracker use case) would benefit.
