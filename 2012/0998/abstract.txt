Tessellations are an interesting way for high school students to learn about Symmetry and Geometry.  Within Inkscape, Cloned Tiles are used to work with wallpaper symmetry groups.  The current UI is dialog and data field driven, an indirect approach which requires pre-knowledge of how symmetry groups work.  The purpose of the current project is to provide on-canvas control of the base tile boundary size, orientation, skew and position, on-canvas control of the number and placement of tiles and minor improvements and bug fixes in other areas related to designing a Tessellation.
