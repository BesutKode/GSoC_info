Use of Weave to the biology research community by designing a process to access publicly available gene expression datasets, import that data into Weave and use Weave analysis features to examine, visualize and compare gene expression profiles. These interactive linked visualizations will allow researchers to visually compare the variations in gene expression relative to a control.
