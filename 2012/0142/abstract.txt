The goal of the relationship editor is to allow users to efficiently add/edit all liner note credits for an album in a single interface. The relationship editor will be a single page, accessible from the release page, that lets you (1) add, edit, and remove relationships to recordings, works, and the release itself, (2) speed up the process of matching works to recordings, and (3) create new works where they don't exist.
