The 52Â°North SOS implements a subset of the O&M data format, because O&M is too flexible to be supported completely. It would be a good alternative, if users could just implement a simple encoding (for example to support their own CSV or JSON data format) and upload a compiled jar file to the SOS with a browser-based user interface. Then a client selects the newly available response format to retrieve the data in a new format. As an extension it would be very useful to researchers and data maintainers in the hydrological and meteorological domain to have the SOS server deliver WaterML2.0 encoded time-series.
Based on the SOS adminstrator project, the desired encodings could be prepared as .jar-files and added via a web frontend.
