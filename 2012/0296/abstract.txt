The Illumos wpad daemon dates back to 2007 after the net80211 module was partially ported from FreeBSD 7 in 2006. It is based on the 0.3x wpa_supplicant branch and lacks of the EAP authentication methods required for WPA-Enterprise support.
Integration of the EAP-TTLS authentication method has already been completed for the OpenSolaris snv_138 release. This project aims to add full WPA-Enterprise support to Illumos WiFi stack on x86 platforms porting the latest stable wpa_supplicant branch, integrating it with dladm, nwam, the net80211 kernel module and preserving the current wifi administration design. Moreover a new backend for managing secure objects, based on the KMF, will be proposed.
