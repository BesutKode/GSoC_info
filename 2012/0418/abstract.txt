My proposal consists of two components. The first and largest component is the development of a fully-featured graphical node editor ("box and hose editor") which will sit on top of the GEGL public API and allow for fast sandboxing of GEGL operations for debugging, artistic, and showcase purposes. The editor will be similar to familiar editors such as Blenders shader editor and the MathMap1 editor. The second component of my proposal is to develop code for saving and loading meta-ops to and from XML (resolving bug 465743). This code will exist within the GEGL codebase and manifest itself as a component of the node editors interface.
