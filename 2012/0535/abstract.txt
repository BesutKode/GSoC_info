The idea behind the project is to create the tools, as well as a graphical user interface, to ease the configuration and testing of joysticks and other input devices under Wine. Some support for this configuration exists already in the form of registry key settings and the objective is to make this easy and intuitive with visualization of joystick axes and buttons, manual testing of force feedback devices, the ability to enable/disable specific connected devices and more.
