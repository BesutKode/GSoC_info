Apache Libcloud is a standard Python library that abstracts away differences among multiple cloud provider APIs. Currently Libcloud has a big limitation - you can only use it with Python. I'm willing to implement HTTP interface for Libcloud which exposes all the Libcloud functionality through a RESTful API. Adding a REST interface would allow users to leverage Libcloud functionality through an arbitrary language which knows how to talk HTTP.
