This feature will enable JRuby to avoid parsing Ruby source, build AST, and generate IR across runs. This feature might be especially useful for faster bootup of short-running programs (ex: tests).This project would have to ensure that the (human-readable) textual output captures all necessary information from IR so that when it is read back in, the IR can be reconstructed without loss of information.
