Oftentimes when we send emails to people we are expecting their replies. There will always be someone overlooking our message or forgetting to write back. No matter what the case, if we really want to gain feedback from as many people as possible, we would like to send reminders to those nonrepliers. It will be very convenient if Thunderbird has the function to automatically check for nonrepliers and keep us informed. This function will also distinct Thunderbird from other remote or local email clients as no other clients has this kind of functionality.
