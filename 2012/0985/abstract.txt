Category theory is a relatively new domain of mathematics which arose in an attempt to generalise existing algebraic structures. Because of the novelty of the approaches used in this domain, the number of people applying it is only increasing slowly. On the other hand, there is no way yet to represent category theoretic reasoning in modern CAS. The goal of this project is making SymPy capable of both representing category theoretic reasoning and carrying out a part of category theoretic reasoning automatically, with main focus on deciding the commutativity of diagrams.
