Computer graphics objects reconstructed from real world contain undesirable noise. A Mesh smoothing removes undesirable noise while still preserving desirable geometric and shape of the original model.
This project improving the mesh smoothing tools in blender, based on curvature flow operator in a diffusion equation.
