My  goal is to work on a Linux games distribution that can be burned on a CD or installed on a USB stick. Gaming is very popular in Asia. Existing popular games can be included. The project also needs to take care to include hardware drivers for a number of possible computer systems. The Linux distro will be based on Debian or Ubuntu. I will integrate an app shop based on the existing Ubuntu app shop. The interface will use lxlauncher. I will join development of the project. My goals are to improve my skills of Vala and C++ and become an active contributor to the projects I use for the distribution.
