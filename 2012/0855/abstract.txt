The goal of this project is to improve the infrastructure in staging and enhance the testing process, by implementing automation, genetic algorithms and unit testing of sub-components. 

This would have the following advantages:

Automation reduces human intervention in the testing process.

Genetic algorithms facilitates the generation of queries which are not only syntactically right, but also logically correct and produces result.

Storage of the test results can be used in execution feedback.

Unit testing eases the testing of individual components and sub-components
