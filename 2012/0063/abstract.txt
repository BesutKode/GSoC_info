Trace Server is used for storing, querying, analyzing and printing collected trace information. Postmortem analyzers can be used to find out about defects.This year's work will be a continuation of GSoC 2010, by implementing new functionality, as well as improving current performance. The plan is to develop new storage, DSL for querying the database, new analyzers, new user interface, use Scala to increase performance and reduce complexity of code.
