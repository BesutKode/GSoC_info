Mobile Sniffer for Android is the application to sniff packets and decode them in a rooted android phone, it uses compiled libpcap as binary to capture packets. There can be various improvements in it such as ability to dump packets,filter packets , payload decoding to achieve application layer details. My proposal tries to complete these improvements. I will also be adding capabilities to sniff Bluetooth interface, this could be achieved by using Bluez library.
