The project is aiming to create a lightweight, easy-to-use extension of the Java PathFinder project that would carry out a dimensional analysis of units used in scientific computation. One of the objectives is for the solution to be applicable on legacy code, so the changes done to the code need to be as minimal as possible. The analysis would be performed during the testing phase, keeping only the floating-point arithmetic in the final binary executable.
