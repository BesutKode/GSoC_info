In project I want to implement a tool which will convert Scratch projects to Catroid projects. From the Scratch project file will be extracted the sounds, images and the list of bricks which are implemented in Catroid. Many Scratch projects rely on variables and operators which are not yet present in Catroid, for a correct functioning of the converter tool I will implement the variables, lists and all the operator blocks from Scratch.
