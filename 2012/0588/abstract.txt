The aim of this project is to improve the Impress svg export filter I started working on the last GSoC. The main goals for the GSoC time-frame are to add support for slide transitions and transformation effects and to carry out a new implementation of the text export feature such that we can provide support for text search engine and text animations. In such a way the user get a complete feature rich presentation in a single svg document that can be displayed in any enough modern browser.
