Due to the great significance of the parallel programming within the scientific community and the adventages openmpi brings us for those purposes, it is natural to think on an extension for cern’s ROOT libraries.
This project will give openmpi the skill to send and receive ROOT’s native datatypes, this through the redefinition of classes according to the necessity of each group of similar datatypes and the implementation of macros and scripts will give the execution and compilation hability to the ROOT’s interpreter (cint), mpirun-like. The design of the execution module through cint was based on buffers of code which will grant the correct definition as openmpi requires for the code block.
