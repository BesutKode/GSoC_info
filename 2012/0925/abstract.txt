One core functionality required in the OpenMonitor project is dynamic scalability. Currently, the list of super-peers is stored statically in a local database. This works fine for a fixed and limited set of peers (which is never the real-time scenario where new peers emerge every second). Thus my proposal is to implement a dynamic super-peer selection and inter-peer routing algorithm for messages, based on Kademlia P2P routing mechanism. Maidsafe-DHT is the reference implementation considered. The implementation is for both the Mobile and the Desktop ICM Agent.
