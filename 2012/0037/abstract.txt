Statsmodels provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, currently it has many features but no support for estimating system of structurally related equations. Since many statistical analyses (e.g., econometrics and biostatistics) are based on system of equations, my proposal is to provide the capability to estimate system of linear equations within the statsmodels module and provide tools for statistical tests.
