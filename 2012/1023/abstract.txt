Implementing a solid working NAT model for the NS3 framework taking into account the different behavior that NAT exhibits in a network equipping the node to act as a successful network edge device, also giving way for further security(firewall) implementations.  This would include reusing Netfilter implementation on NS3 to facilitate NAT and then implement NAT itself. This would mimc the Linux NAT model and have added extensions.
