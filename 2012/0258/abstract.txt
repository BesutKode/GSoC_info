digiKam has two plugin architectures: one for the Album GUI(which includes Kipi-plugins and which is shared with other kipi-host applications) and one for the image editor(implemented using KDE XML-GUI). The first one was written before the release of the KDE XML-GUI and now is deprecated. It must be rewritten in order to be more flexible and to permit a higher degree of customization of the GUI with less effort using XML configuration files.
