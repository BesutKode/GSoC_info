The scikit-learn library has become very successful due to its complementary goals of being comprehensive and efficient. Many core pieces of code are highly efficient and compete with famous implementations. This project aims to bring a uniform standard of speed through quality iterations over the code of the less optimized corners of the codebase. We will also add a continuous benchmark in the spirit of speed.pypy.org that will make it easy to ensure that what's fast stays fast, and what's slow is easy to find.
