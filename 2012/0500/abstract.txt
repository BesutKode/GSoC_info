I plan to create a fully operational REST interface which should map directly to CRUD operations which act on a database of gene lists. The RESTful application will be written in python, and interact directly with a MongoDB store which contains a collection of all gene lists. A computation engine will be created to calculate statistical enrichment using an all to all comparison of gene lists. By accomplishing this project, users will have an alternate method to discovering similar genes to ones they are interested in.
