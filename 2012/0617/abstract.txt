Currently LDV tools are used to check Linux device drivers against several safety rules, each of which formally defines what is correct usage of a particular part of kernel core API. Each rule also represents one or more typical misuse of the kernel core interfaces. By the moment, the framework contains 5 rules formalized only. This project is aimed at extending number of rules supported by the framework.
