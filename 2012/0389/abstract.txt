In last years Google Summer of Code development started on the ATutor Calendar module. The initial structure for the module, and its linking into other ATutor modules to collect dates (e.g tests dates, assignments due, course start dates) were setup to automatically generate content for the calendar. The aim of this project is to build on these features, making it possible for students and instructors to create personal calendar entries, to share entries, and to integrate other calendar data (e.g. Google Calendar, Outlook) into their calendars.
