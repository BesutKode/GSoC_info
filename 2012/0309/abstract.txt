Big data era is coming and it calls for revolutionary new levels of capacity and performance for statistical analysis of very big matrices in the popular R language. With regard to it, this project aims at providing super scalable predictive analytics to meet this challenge. Using the built-in “BigMatrix” package, R users are able to analyze (feature selection, classification, clustering and etc) the datasets.  The data set can be both big (even larger than the RAM) and messy (lots of missing values). The project is targeted for a wide range of researchers and the potential applications include but not limited to financial marketing data, big genomic data and huge web data.
