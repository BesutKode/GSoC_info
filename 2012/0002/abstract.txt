This document details the proposal of a project to the NUI Group (Natural User Interface) for the Google Summer of Code, 2012 edition. The project's goal is to create easily scaled open source infrared multi-touch frame in order to let people build their own frames and develop further projects using this information. Cost of existing infrared frames with true multitouch support is quite overvalued in comparison to summary cost of the components. With open source frame, this situation can be changed, due to growth of  competition between independent manufacturers. And, ideally, will bring significant decrease of cost for this frames, and, as a result, cost of devices, that use this technology.
