The aim of this project is to integrate support for sandboxed builds into Cabal, a system for building Haskell projects. There are several different third-party implementations of this functionality already available, but it would be beneficial (from the points of ease of use and focusing the community efforts) to have a unified and polished solution integrated into Cabal itself. Additionally, this project is a step in the direction of solving the infamous "dependency hell" problem of Cabal.
