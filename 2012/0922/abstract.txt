This project aims to provide a UI for administering the Laboratory module of the Raxa EMR using JSP and JQuery in correspondence with the Spring MVC framework. Focus will be on providing complete configurability of the system’s catalog of tests and all related objects – such as preconditions, test results and their interpretation and relevant specimen types for the test. At the same time high priority will be given to maximise usability across different devices.
