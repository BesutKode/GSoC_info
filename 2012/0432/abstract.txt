SilverStripe has a set of features to support developers. However, these features depend on manually adding GET parameters to the URL. The goal of this proposal is to make the tools available at a central, easy to find location in form of a developer toolbar. In addition to this, I will modify the existing logging system, centralizing functionality in SS_Log. I will add a new log target that allows to log to the toolbar. Furthermore, I plan to add filtering and sorting capabilities to make the interesting information easier to find.
