There are already a number of gallery and photosy stems available, but none of the systems (Gallery2, Gallery3, Photosites based on Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla and others) have a simple way to upload photos from a mobile app and to show photos on a photo map. The idea of this project is to develop a website that offers a simple API to allow uploading of photos from a smartphone and showing them on a map on the web service.
