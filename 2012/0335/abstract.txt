Pysoy currently lacks proper testing coverage, which harms the development of the engine and makes it easier to reintroduce past bugs while developing. Furthermore, the recent merger of the experimental branch has left some of the documentation out-dated and most of the example programs non-functional. This proposal is a project to write a set of unit tests and doctests, write new example programs based on the old ones to showcase Pysoy's capabilities and to overall fix minor bugs, clean up the codebase and improve documentation.
