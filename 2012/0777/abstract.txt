This is a plugin for Pathvisio, which shows information of a selected metabolite. This info contains general info of the metabolite, such as the name, ID and InChI IDs. Furthermore, it also describes predicted MS and NMR peaks and links out to pictures of NMR and MS spectra. CDK (Chemistry Development Kit) is also used to predict 13C NMR spectra and is also visualized in this plugin. In this way, the user has access to two 13C peak lists.
