ResK is a proof compression library. Currently some compression algorithms for propositional resolution proofs are implemented. They use a dedicated data structure that should be soon obsoleted.

The goal of this proposal is to port those algorithms to the new sequent calculus data structure and to implement some more similar algorithms.
