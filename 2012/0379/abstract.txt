Overall, my project proposal concerns the development of the main tools necessary for SAR imagery georeferencing and orthorectification, exploiting the full capabilities of the sensor. In particular, I would like to include in Opticks a robust rigorous orientation model for two SAR high resolution sensors:  RADARSAT-2 and TerraSAR-X.  In addition, I will provide an handy tool to perform 3D stereo measurements.
