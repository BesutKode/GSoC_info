During GSoC I will implement warehouse/inventory module for the nodewatcher system. This module will establish inventory control system for equipment used at Wlan Slovenija organization. Network administrators will be able to assign internal identifier codes to equipment (routers, antennas, pigtails adapters) and tools (RJ45 crimp tools). Additionally, they will be able to relocate/assign inventory from the database to different people and/or hot spot locations.
