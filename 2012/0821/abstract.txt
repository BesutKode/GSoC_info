This project aims at developing a system with a web interface which can be used to create 3D models of various objects via Kinect and interface them to Zeega through its API.
1) Developing an intuitive web interface with instructions to use the kinect 
2)Scanning of objects via kinect to create 3D models in the form of .ply/.png files
3)Output 3D model to MeshLab for cleaning up of mesh and develop into a robust manipulable file
4)The resulting output file will be sent to the web interface which in turn will be exposed to Zeega via its API
