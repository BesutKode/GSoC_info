This project would first add support for quadratic, linear, and conical solvers to PortfolioAnalytics, and some intelligence to detect optimization objectives that would be suitable for this kind of back-end. For example, mean-variance portfolios with simple box constraints are quadratic, mean-gaussian-ETL objectives are linear or conical, etc.  Additionally to add support for more global optimization solvers like a particle swarm optimization solver.
