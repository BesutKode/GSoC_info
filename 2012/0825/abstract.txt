Spectrum is an XMPP gateway that allows XMPP users to communicate with friends who belong to one of the supported networks such as Jabber, MSN, Yahoo, ICQ etc. Currently, Spectrum provides Twitter support by using microblog-purple  plugin. However, this plugin is difficult to use because of the new Spectrum 2 design. The goal of this project is to implement a new standalone Twitter backend for Spectrum 2.
