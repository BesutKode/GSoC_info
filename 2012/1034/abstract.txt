Exploring structured binary data is frequently necessary in HelenOS. Hex editors and scripting languages require too much work and don't handle the data in a fully structured way. I will create a portable library and tools to make exploring structured binary data faster and easier. Although some tools already exist, my approach is more general and powerful. I will focus on making my tools highly versatile and making it easy to handle new structures.
