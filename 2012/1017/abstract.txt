I would like to work on adding SO_TIMESTAMPING options to the NetBSD kernel. I intend to add apropriate support for these options at all levels of the networking stack, starting from user interface and
finishing with the driver implementation. The parts of the kernel that I will be modifying are the IPv4/v6 socket options, the ethernet structures and functions and perhaps, if needed, the interface (ifp) definition. Along with these I intend to add, in a modular manner, timestamping support to at least one driver in a manner that allows
easy porting to other drivers.
