With my proposal, I want to focus on two issues: the general performance of DBpedia Spotlight and the annotation accuracy. To adress the performance issue, changes to the core architecture are suggested that allow more control in the implementation and storage of the required data. For an improvement in annotation accuracy, I propose the implementation of an entity mention model with topical information.
