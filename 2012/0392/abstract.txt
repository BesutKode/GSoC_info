The main goal of the project is to make RTEMS capable of supporting memory protection through MMU/MPU for any target by redesigning the current High-level API that could be used by developers without the need to know low-level implementations for a specific target. Then implementing mid/low-level API for ARM architecture to be used by the defined High-level API.
