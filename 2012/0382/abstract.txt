This project aims to add support for third party login and integration with phpBB. It will be compatible with multiple third party services. The ability for plugin writers to easily add support for other services will be a top priority in the structure of the code. It will allow users to authorize and deauthorize a third party service to be used to login. It will also allow the board administrator to choose which, if any, of the third party services to support.
