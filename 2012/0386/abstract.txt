To develop and test a Weave-to-JAWS interface to allow JAWS access to descriptions of Weave visualizations. This will make descriptions of Weave visualizations available in text format. This is a first step in a larger more ambitious project that will eventually allow Weave to generate natural language text descriptions of interactive visualizations that are compatible with the JAWS screen reading system.
