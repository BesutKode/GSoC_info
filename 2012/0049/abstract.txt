The project aims to complete LwIP integration into MINIX 3. Basic support has already been added but it isn't complete and hasn't been tested properly yet. This project will be about completing that work and then adding new features like IP routing, forwarding, IPv6 support, NPF support. There are also some secondary goals like developing core LwIP for the benefit of both MINIX 3 and LwIP communities.
