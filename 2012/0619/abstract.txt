Wine is an tool that allows users to run Windows software without actually having to use the Windows operating system. Though the security standard for years has been RSA enhanced, some application use DSS which has not yet been implemented in Wine. This is where I will be implementing the DSS (digital signature standard) provider within Wine. By implementing PROV_DSS, a  provider type, I will be able to solve bugs caused by the lack of this provider.
