The markovchain package contains classes and methods to easily handle Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) processes. It currently is very helpful to performing standard analysis of DTMC and it is easy to use. It is needed in both internal code optimization (keeping the end - user interface the same) as well as enhancements in the statistical and probabilistic functions provided (more fitting methods, estimating the parameters by Maximum Likelihood, and improved algorithms to classify states).
