A motivated ASU Neuroscience PhD student, advised by Dr. Sharon Crook, who has extensive professional full-time software development experience, proposes to convert three, or more, if time permits, large-scale models of thalamocortical systems to PyNN and NeuroML. Such conversions to open, simulator-independent formats would increase the re-use of model components and make models available to greater number of simulation platforms.
