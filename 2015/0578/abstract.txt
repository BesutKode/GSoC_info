Johnny is a GUI for John the Ripper which is a console application. It makes it easier to do most of the basic and advanced functionnalities of the original console software . The current version of Johnny is version 1.1 and the goal of this proposal is to follow the development road available at http://openwall.info/wiki/john/johnny-roadmap and to develop as much improvements as I can. I'd like to get to version 2.0 (the first stable release) and also find new ideas to improve it.
