Deep Learning (DL) can be identified as one of the most controversial recent Machine Learning techniques that attempt to perform effective feature extraction. DL is a representation learning technique recently invented. DL allows the businesses to leverage large unstructured datasets more effectively. Objectives of this project are developing a Jaggery [2] interface to interact with DL and implement DL in the underlying logical layer.
