Omnidirectional cameras consist of fish eye and catadioptric ones, while Opencv now can only calibrate fish-eye. A calibration tool based on C Mei's unified model [1] which can calibration all omnidirectional cameras will be implemented. The conventional stereo rectify gets perspective images and need very large images to contain all details. I will use a longitude-latitude mapping [2] which can preserve all details while not increasing image size. Stereo matching can still be applied in a line.
