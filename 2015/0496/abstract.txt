ScalaMeter is a performance testing tool for JVM. With concise and simple DSL it allows to focus on benchmark code and handles automatically noise from GC or JIT. The plan is to extend it with JMH support, which is a new but quite well-known framework for benchmarking on JVM. Next thing to do is to write binary compatible data format for benchmark results. Moreover, additional performance metrics should be added, and existing ones should produce more generic results not limited only to Double's.
