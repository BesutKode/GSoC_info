One problem with traditionally scraping websites using XPath and CSS selectors is that when a website changes its layout your spiders may no longer work. This project aims to use crawl datasets to try to build new Portia spiders from website content and extracted data, repair spiders if the website layout has changed and then merge the templates used by the spiders into a small manageable number.
