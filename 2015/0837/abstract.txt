The Dungeon will be composed of Room scenes. Before the Dungeon class can be implemented, portals will have to be added to allow for transition of bodies from one Room scene to another. The Room scene will also have to be improved, with addition of doors (Portals) being one essential addition (among others). Once this is done, functions and GUI will be designed to facilitate the creation of dungeons since creating dungeons one room at a time through API calls will be too lengthy.
