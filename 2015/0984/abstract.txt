Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) is used to create visual representations of the connections of the brain also known as tractography. Research has shown that by using a tissue classifier more accurate representations of the underlying connections are calculated. The goal of this project is to generate tissue classifiers using dMRI or a different MRI modality e.g. T1-weighted MRI (T1). I will implement popular segmentation algorithms using T1 as well as new ones using dMRI data.
