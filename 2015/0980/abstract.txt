Hbase, similar to Accumulo is an open-source, scalable, distributed, versioned, non-relational database modeled after Google's Bigtable paper. Currently GeoWave supports and can work only with Accumulo. This project aims to add support for Hbase in GeoWave and the user will have an option to choose between Accumulo and Hbase depending on his/her use-case. This will ensure that users of GeoWave can make use of the best of both the worlds.
