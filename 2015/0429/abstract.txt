Planning telescope observations using Python presently requires non-trivial amounts of coding in order to calculate rise/set times, airmass, moon separation, etc. I'd like to build an observational tool set using existing Astropy modules that would allow the user to quickly produce tables and plots with just a few lines of code. Users could modify the toolbox to suit their own needs with optional profiles. Other products may include IPython notebook examples with sample data and a simple GUI.
