Pander is an R package for rendering R objects on markdown. It provides extensive support for different R classes combined with a lot of rendering options.
During this GSoC session I want to improve on 4 things about Pander package: 
1. Improve current test suite for pander package
2. Refactor pandoc.table function
3. Add rendering support for not yet supported R classes
4. Create a use-case specific vignettes and add more examples
