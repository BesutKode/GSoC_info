Even though MusicBrainz has a huge database of music information, the accessibility of those information to a general user seems low. For retrieving useful information from the database, one must have some understanding on the query syntax that needs to be followed. This proposal contains information on building a graphical user interface for both searching as well as browsing through the data in the database only just from mouse clicks without the user needing to know any of the query syntax.
