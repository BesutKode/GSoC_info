Expand LightMelody to support multi party voice chat by implementing XMPP Jingle protocol and testing it against WebRTC Jingle libraries to ensure web compatibility. We use SRTP, DTLS handshake, ICE for NAT traversal to include security and authentication mechanisms in our voice chat and Opus Codec as audio codec. Since, Jingle is a way to negotiate only peer to peer sessions, Muji is implemented for managing the multi party voice chat within an XMPP Multi User Chat (MUC).
