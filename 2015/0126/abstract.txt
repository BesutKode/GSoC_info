The Evolution Schema is a subsystem of the ROOT framework which allows to support objects of old versions of classes without original compiled code. Itâ€™s important if we deal with long-lived  serialized data while continuing development of programming application. The aim of the project is to add a support for new features in evolution schema to increase flexibility and performance when reading old files.
