Current Rails Cookie System does not have a mechanism to expire a cookie, and purpose of a cookie is not defined. Apparently, cookies are not very secure. This project will make the expiry of cookies possible on the server side and also add purpose field for cookies. To make this integration with the current structure, I will also refactor the cookie internals. Upgrade paths will also be taken care of, so that cookies are readable even after a user upgrades his application.
