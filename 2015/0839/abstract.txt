For this project, I plan to have the XMark Benchmark work on VXQuery. I plan to use test-driven development and split my project into four phases. The first phase involves building a test suite. The second phase involves determining and logging the errors by creating issues to the JIRA Issue list. The third phase involves implementing a mentor-determined optimal solution for the failing queries. The last phase involves documenting the supported XMark queries on the VXQuery website.
