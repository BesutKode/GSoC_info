The Systers GSoC project I am applying for is the Testing Automation project. Since it is expanding to all of the projects, I would like to make testing automation as simple as possible for all of the users. I would set up the test environments, specific features for each of the program's tests using the previous year's project as an example, debug and tweak issues that arise along the way, and then finally implement a nice GUI to make the process feel more professional and streamlined.
