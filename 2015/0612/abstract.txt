The goal of this project is to build a prototype tool for extracting and reviewing genomic markers from clinical trial records. Complete clinical trial data is available from the National Institutes of Health. Data sets are also available for download in XML format. However, and unfortunately, genomic biomarkers are not specifically enumerated as distinct elements within the XML, and it remains an open question as to how best extract this information.
