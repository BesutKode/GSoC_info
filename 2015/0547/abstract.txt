My name is Oliver Luo. I’m a student from Peking University and major in computer science. I don’t have much experience as a contributor in the open source world, but I learn quickly and have the necessary programming skills required by the project I proposed to. I’ve been communicating with Mr. Woodhouse, as my potential mentor, about this module, Evolution-ActiveSync, and made a detailed schedule with his help. I’m digging into the project now and really hope to get this chance.
