statsmodels.regression.mixed_linear module is relatively new. I am proposing to  implement support for non linear mixed models,  heteroscedastic residual errors  and adding support for crossed random effects using a non-cholmod support. As a bonus, few functions from `lmm` R package would be ported. As a wrap-up, iPython notebooks with detailed examples and benchmarked agains `lme4`, `nlme` and `lmm` R pakges would be developed.
