The main point of the project is to implement a D-Bus library that can work directly with asyncio event loop. While one of the options would be to extend the current python-dbus implementation with asyncio functionality, the idea is to write the library in pure Python without any dependencies on C extensions. The library will be installable by pip, which would simplify its deployment compared to python-dbus.  Currently no alternative dbus binding for Python has such kind of functionality.
