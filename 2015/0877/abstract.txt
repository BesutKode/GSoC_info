IPOP could be adopted by a wider audience, if the whole process of setting up and configuring the nodes, XMPP/TURN servers becomes easy. Currently the entire process of setting up TURN/XMPP servers is done through a CLI, and configuring the nodes is done manually. This can be cumbersome and sometimes intimidating for end users. This problem can easily solved with the help of a Web UI, that could configure and manage XMPP, STUN, TURN servers, and generate configuration files for IPOP endpoints.
