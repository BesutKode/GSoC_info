One of the aspects that OpenCog is covering under AGI is 'unsupervised language learning'. One of the major steps in the language learning process is to address the morphological variations of the words. My project will address the morphological dependencies in two languages: (1) Hindi, (2) Gujarati. This will provide a list of morphemes, and also a list of rules about which way the morphemes can be combined. These will be supported strongly with the statistics on the large unannotated corpus.
