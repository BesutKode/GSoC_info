With the successful development of particle tracking API of the SixTrack last summer, its time to augment it with the power of parallel computing. But before extending the API to subsume new physics model and harness parallel processing capabilities, a review and testing of the developed API needs to be done. The final aim of this project is to prove the numerical stability of the equations and correctness of the implementation by extensively testing it against the legacy FORTRAN code.
