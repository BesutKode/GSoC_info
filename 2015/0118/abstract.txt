Mobile phones, especially smartphones, came to our life very quickly. We use them every day and sometimes more often than our computers. At the moment there is no way to use Hawkular comfortably on Android, there is only a web interface. This conclusion assumes that some work should be done to provide a new way of user interaction with Hawkular. My work is to implement this idea in an Android application for Hawkular.
