Loklak provides the mechanism to search anonymously, with fewer limits and from more sources in the future. At the current state, JSON results and loklak API are very flexible for developers to use. My proposal, in short, aims to provide a single page web interface to additive search, filter, re-order, and track the result of a search operation. This web page can meet and exceed the expectations of  general users, who are restrained by the service provider, such as Twitter and its search page.
