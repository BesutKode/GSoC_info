Firstly I would work towards implementing a Uniform DeSTIN i.e. achieving scale, rotation and shear in-variance. Next: using variants of Conceptor Networks and implementing Convolutional DeSTIN. Finally, I will be building a image pre-processing pipeline to extract high quality features for observations. Several other ambitious experiments would be carried out as well. Overall, the performance - in terms of speed and accuracy - of Python-DeSTIN would be improved.
