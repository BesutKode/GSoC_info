I don't have to tell you for you to know that collaboration tool for designers suck. Enter GG(GlitterGallery), with options to share your work publicly and collaborate with others. Backed with git and integration with sparkleshare, on GG you will be able to host your local as well as online repos. It requires work on its commenting system, view of the history and projects' landing page, integration of sparkleshare and inkscape, adding tags to projects and issues etc.
