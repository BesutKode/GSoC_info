Many useful edge-aware filters were recently implemented in OpenCV, including Guided Filter and Domain Transform Filter. However, several novel techniques were proposed in the last year: Fast Weighted Median Filter, Fast Global Smoother to name a few. They outperform previous approaches in a range of applications and therefore their implementation in OpenCV might be beneficial for the community.
