Engineers at CERN write scientific code which has to run fast in order to process the Petabyte of data which their experiments produce daily.
For this to be possible, their code has to be analyzed and improved at assembly level. To come in the aid of this, I plan to develop an interactive web-app which will let the programmers easily browse through binaries and understand the control flow of a program. This project also includes an eclipse plugin which will provide unit testing functionality.
