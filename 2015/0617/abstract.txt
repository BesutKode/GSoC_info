This Google Summer of Code Project will focus on improving the integration of ClojureScript with the existing JavaScript ecosystem. The first part of this project will be to add CommonJS, AMD and ECMAScript 6 module support, meaning that JavaScript modules can be included and used in a ClojureScript project. The second part of this project will focus on generating extern files for non-Closure compatible JavaScript libraries to simplify the use of JavaScript libraries in a ClojureScript project.
