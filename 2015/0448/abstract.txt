This project aims to update the JEditTextArea, currently at the heart of the Editor, with the RSyntaxTextArea and the AutoComplete code completion library, which would together bring several new features to the table, such as code folding, documentation support and parameter assistance, in such a way as to ensure backward compatibility with existing tools and modes. It also aims to complete a new REPL Mode for processing, on which I began work as a warm-up task during GSoC 2014.
