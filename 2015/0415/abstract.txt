This GSOC project aims to improve interactive data exploration and visualization of MNE-python. The improvements would be made for plotting functions, including plotting raw data, epochs, TFR and evoked responses. Some of the plotting functions would have interactive features for user to select/deselect plots, events etc. The visualization will rely mainly on matplotlib libraries.
