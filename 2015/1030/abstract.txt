Pencil Code has a simple debugger that shows some visual information about how your program executed, but it is very limited in what it can do. It would be very helpful to users of Pencil Code to be able to follow the execution of their programs both forward and backward, step by step, with much more information about the program state displayed to them, all with a beginner-friendly UI. My proposal is to work with the Pencil Code team to implement this visual debugger.
