Syslog-ng is a highly configurable log management tool designed to work with various sources and destinations. The goal of this project is to extend the functionality of syslog-ng by implementing the standard input (as a source plugin) and the standard output (as a destination plugin) and making it possible to use syslog-ng as a command line tool without losing any of its notable features.
