A refactoring of PyROOT and Cppyy is proposed, using the advanced reflection capabilities of the new cling backend of ROOT 6 to provide more flexible automatic bindings of C++ code to idiomatic Python, substantially surpassing current technologies and improving maintainability. An API for fine-tuning these bindings will be designed and implemented for both CPython and PyPy, providing control over memory management and locking at the same time as idiomatic access to C++ classes and functions.
