Currently the reporting module lacks of an easy way to share reports between implementations of the OpenMRS software and adding this feature is what this project aims to.
The goal of the XML Reports project is to design and add to the module a new markup-like descriptor that uses the features of the XML language to describe reports in a textual data format, along with a new set of user-friendly interfaces that supports the new descriptor and its elements.
