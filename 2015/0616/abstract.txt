Once CentOS for ARM is released, board vendors will want to release custom images. Every vendor will have their kernel,firmware & bootloader that they would want to integrate into images. I would like to work on a set of tools & scripts that makes generation of such images easy. Available tools like ImageFactory presently focus mainly on VM & cloud images. For handling the nitty-gritty of ARM systems I propose development of a set of yum plugins & tools, either separately or with ImageFactory.
