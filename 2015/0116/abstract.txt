Currently, kdelibs is distributed as a single set of interconnected libraries
which makes it bulky. Under the KDE Frameworks 5 efforts, these libraries are
being remodelled into a set of independent modules enabling the developers
to use only the specific parts which they need and avoid pulling unwanted
dependencies.
Amarok currently uses Qt 4, kdelibs and Plasma 4. This project aims to port
amarok to Qt 5 while using KDE Frameworks 5 enabling amarok to derive
their benefits.
