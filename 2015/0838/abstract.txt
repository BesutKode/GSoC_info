My proposal is to implement a fast, class-based, sparse series expansion infrastructure in Sympy and  CSymPy, along with a fast Polynomial module for CSymPy, that can handle series related operations. The proposed series and Polynomials module for CSymPy will be among the fastest and comparable in speed with Mathematica, Maple and Ginac. The new Series class in Sympy will significantly improve the performance of series expansion.
