The goal of this project is to extend the Probabilistic Logic Network framework within OpenCog to modal reasoning. This would allow autoepistemic reasoning within PLN, which would be a significant addition to the existing temporal and causal reasoning implementation. A second related part of the project involves extension of modal reasoning to indefinite probabilities within PLN framework.
