Current RTEMS lacks support of Raspberry Pi - cheap, open-source small computer. These qualities have made RPi so widespread and being used almost everywhere, including education sphere. RTEMS on RPi would attract new audience that is looking for real-time OS, since default Linux isn’t real-time. I chose this project because I’m familiar with USB and I love system programming and embedded systems.
