TASTY is a typed AST pickling format implemented in the Dotty compiler. The main goal of this project is to provide an implementation of TASTY for the Scala ecosystem. Such implementation for Scala will facilitate the use of typed ASTs as an interchange format for compiler interactions, enable powerful optimizations based on additional information from persisted trees, and enable several advanced features of scala.meta.
