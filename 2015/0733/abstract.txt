In line with one of core values of FLE, “Design for Everyone”, this project aims to improve the accessibility of KA Lite, an offline version of Khan Academy, by exploring the experience of diverse learners through user testing, and letting the results of those tests guide the technical solutions. Project will use the Website Accessibility Conformance Evaluation Methodology (WCAG-EM) to determine compliance with WCAG 2.0, and try to integrate a11y into the  automated test workflow of KA Lite.
