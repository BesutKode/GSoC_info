Subsurface in its current state is primarily designed to be used on a personal computer. Although it can be compiled for Android devices, the user interface is not really usable on mobile devices. Using QML, we can create a new user interface targeted at Android mobile phones and tablets. This QML based interface will maintain the C/C++ back-end, resulting in a unified code-base which will be easy to maintain, and new features will be easy to implement on both mobile and desktop devices.
