The project's goal is to improve Scala’s utility as a scripting language. A new interpreter will be crated based on Scala’s REPL. The overhead of starting a new JVM and a new compiler for running each script will be removed by keeping a single interpreter instance alive. The memory management of the interpreter will be improved. Compilation times for script files will be amortized by caching. Dynamically loading Maven artifacts with built-ins from script files will be made possible.
