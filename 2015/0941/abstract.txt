Virtual Machines, due to their portable nature, are used in different virtual environments like clouds. These VMs need a way to configure themselves according to the environment they are in. This process is called contextualization and consists of user management, firewall configuration, and much more. However, current tools used for contextualization are heavyweight, slow and hard to customize. This proposal proposes a new contextualization tool that solves these problems.
