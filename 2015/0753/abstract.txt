Currently jclouds supports storing local data on disk through the filesystem provider, but unfortunately it doesn't fully work on every operative system. A JDBC Blobstore would be a truly portable alternative to the filesystem blobstore for local storage and would also provide access to remote databases for remote storage, allowing jclouds users to store data and metadata in any database with a JDBC driver.
