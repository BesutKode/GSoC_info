I would like to create a p5.js library for interacting with hardware input streams via node.js. I anticipate focusing on streams from Tessel and Arduino in particular but generalizing enough to work with other inputs.

This project would include not just the library itself, but also creating tutorials, examples and other documentation. Should this project not take the entire summer, I would spend the rest of my time working to help augment existing tutorials and examples.
