The project aims to protect you from malicious USB  device. If someone will try to connect a USB device with ​unknown descriptors ​(your PC has not seen them before), then that port will be blocked and the attacker will have no chance to steal/destroy your data through USB ports. Under the guidance of Tobias Mueller, the final product of the project will bring a more secure environment for users and will put GNOME on a higher position on the security domain.
