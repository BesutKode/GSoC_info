This project aims at improving BRL-CADâ€™s Geometry Engine (which provides a clean and easy to use API for BRL-CAD's libraries and binaries) -  by adding functionalities to the present primitive classes in the core C++ interface. 
The project is divided into two parts :
1) Adding functions for finding Volume and Centroid of the primitives
2) Adding functions for finding Surface Area of the primitives
