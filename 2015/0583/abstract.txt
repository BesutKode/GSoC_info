Industrial strength refactoring tools are something that the Haskell community as a whole has desired for a number of years. As a result a number of projects have spawned to provide varying levels of abstraction to the refactoring process. Recently, ghc-exactprint has promised to provide a robust foundation for refactoring. This summer I propose to use ghc-exactprint and HaRe to add a --refactor flag to HLint which will automatically apply relevant suggestions.
