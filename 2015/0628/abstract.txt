KStars is a desktop planetarium application under the KDE Education Project. The project idea is to add constellation artwork unto the sky map and integrate it into KStars. I propose to implement the 88 modern constellations recognised by the International Astronomy Union (IAU), and the 27 asterisms from the Indian system called Nakshatras. This framework could be extended to support any future sky culture if the images are compatible with KStars.
