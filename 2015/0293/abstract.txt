The goal is to extract factual information from free text coming from Wikipedia. Finding an automated way of performing this would give a great boost to the whole DBpedia ecosystem as most of the information is currently extracted from the infoboxes, leaving a considerable amount of data untouched. The idea is to use frame semantics and machine learning to extract relevant information and to classify the facts into an ontology.
