Hi, My name is Denis Surin. I am a student, studying on last course (4 years) in the State Polytechnic University. My major is mathematics - programming. I would like to do the "Show Referring Objects" project, based on the already existing features of the garbage collector and use interface of displaying local variables as a basis for data output. I think it is extremely helpful when you read unfamiliar code, and debug an already written function.
