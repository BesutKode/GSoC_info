Bika LIMS uses ZODB at the back-end which is an object oriented database. But some peers use relational database and they find it easy to work with SQL databases. This project will provide an extensible framework to map ZODB objects into a specified schema as needed. A specific instance of that for a PostgreSQL database will be provided. SQL mirroring with additional capabilities to improve the search-ability will be provided along with the test cases and the documentation.
