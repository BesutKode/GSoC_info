While Bika LIMS already has the basics for Product and Sample References management, as well as some simple Supply Order functionality, this module has been neglected for too long. 

In most cases the inventory management of lab products and reagents are managed by an external application (ERP) using Bika's JSON API, a Bika module will add better customised functionality, suitable for resource limited settings too, yet sophisticated enough to deal with best of breed requirements.
