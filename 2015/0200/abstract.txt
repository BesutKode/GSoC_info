This migration feature for Hadoop allows clusters to pause and transfer a job mid-computation elsewhere. This is beneficial because, while running concurrent jobs with limited resources, if one job is more critical, the less-critical job can be moved elsewhere, freeing up needed resources. Secondly, with variable pricing for electricity, data centers would be able to use this migration feature to exploit pricing differences between two sites to reduce the cost of energy units for a computation.
