Extend IPOP with a Web-based user interface, which will allow users to manage their private IPOP VPNs. This involves configuring and managing XMPP, STUN, TURN servers, generating configuration files for IPOP endpoints and monitoring the participating nodes. Currently, these tasks are done with CLI and manual configuration of IPOP endpoints.  A Web-based application would greatly lower the barrier of use and adoption of IPOP.
