The design of a custom hardware interface for GNSS-SDR started with Google Summer of Code - 2014 and this is a continuation of the previous year effort to build a customized hardware platform for GNSS-SDR.  A fully integrated software defined radio receiver that can tune to multiple GNSS constellations and can provide samples to the GNSS-SDR software suite for processing is the vision behind this project.
