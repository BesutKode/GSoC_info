I will develop a interactive browser application that visualizes similarities between patients based on the molecular and clinical patient data, which should serve as a visual aid in the analyzation of TCGA data. In agreement with the architecture of the OpenHealth app, the analytical processing of the data will take place in the browser on the client side. Javascript will be used for the numerical and algorithmic aspect and WebGL for the illustration.
