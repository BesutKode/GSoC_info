The Microsoft Visual C++ iostream library is a now obsolete library distributed with Visual Studio versions up to 6.0, implemented in the file msvcirt.dll. Many legacy applications need its stream-related functions, but the current Wine implementation is merely a stub. The purpose of this project is to implement a reasonable subset of these functions while trying to reuse as much of the current code as possible.
