Last year during the GSoC2014 I implemented the feature to allow an unlogged table to be changed to logged, but the desing chosen was to rewrite the entire heap in a new relfilenode with a new relpersistence, however this design lead us to performance problems with large relations because the relation should be rewritten, so this project will change the current desing of the mechanism of change an unlogged table to logged without the need to rewrite the entire heap.
