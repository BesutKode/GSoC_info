CDK (Component Developer Kit) is a project i find very interesting seeing that it will add more flexibility to the system. Sometime, users specifically experienced one, are stuck during there development because a feature they want to use is unavailable as a component. Having a Component Developer Kit will allow them to build their apps more efficiently. Furthermore, this can be a starting point for an open plugin store where developers can submit created components.
