This proposal consists of the implementation of 3 independent security improvements to Wget. 
HTTP Strict Transport Policy (HSTS), HttpOnly Cookie support and FTPS. Collectively these contribute to making Wget a safer tool, protect users from many security threats and provide new choices for safe file downloading via FTP.

An alternate project is proposed, implementing basic HTTP/2 support.
