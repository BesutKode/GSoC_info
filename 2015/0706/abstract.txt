Medical image archives consists of heterogeneous data sources. Multiple data sources and databases store the medical images, which need to be federated and integrated for more complex use case scenarios. The data consumer should be able to federate interesting data across diverse data sets without knowing much about the information model of the different data sources. Future work identified in the last GSoC should be implemented and the platform should be integrated with the current work.
