The Cyme library provides wrapper functions for math operations, while performing vectorization to maximize hardware utilization. It is  currently only supported on the PowerPC A2 processor.

My main goal is to extend the back-end support for the Cyme library, so that it can be run on Power7, Power8, and ARM processors.
