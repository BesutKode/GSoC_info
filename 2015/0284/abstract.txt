Sharing specific tracks or statistics is currently not possible on enviroCar. So this project is to enhance the enviroCar with sharing facilities and social media links by implementing a REST interface for creating and providing track visualisations and statistics. Furthermore, enviroCar should be linked to social networks, such as Google Plus, Facebook or Twitter. Therefore, this project will utilize the APIs of these platforms and integrate it within the user profile pages of enviroCar.
