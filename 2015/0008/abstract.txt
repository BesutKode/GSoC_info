GenApp is a modular framework for multiscale science computations. Apache Airavata is a software framework for executing and managing computational jobs and workflows on distributed computing resources. The primary goal of this project is to extend GenApp for java Application and integrating it with Airavata to be able to execute long running computational jobs.Also, we need to fix previously integrated html5 version to work with new Airavata.
