Apache Airavata is a software framework for scheduling and executing scientific jobs and workflows on distributed computing resources. The primary goal of this project is to integrate a decision engine and benchmark framework into Airavata. By using these features, Airavata will be able to estimate wait and execution times for the various computing resources. Users will then be able to identify and select the optimal resource for a job.
