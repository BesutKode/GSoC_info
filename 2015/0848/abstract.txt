The current Pattern Miner I developed last year in Opencog is not distributed. In a lot of practical cases,  the data amount for processing is huge, which requires the Pattern Miner can work in a distributed way. I am willing to implement this. There are two options upon implementation: 1. Distribution via network; 2. Distribution via sub-result files merging. Both options have different difficulties that I will discuss in the detailed content of this proposal.
