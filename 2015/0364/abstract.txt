I am a second year PhD student in Texas A&M University, majoring in computer science.

In my proposal, I present an approach to implement a real-like analysis environment using programming analysis. My approach is two-fold, which includes 1) applying static analysis to analyze the environment-checking logic, and identify the events that hide malicious behaviors; 2) dynamically providing required value to bypass the environment-checking logic and dynamically triggering required events.
