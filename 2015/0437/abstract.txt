Many chat clients, such as Pidgin/Finch, support Facebook chat via the XMPP interface.  There are two key issues with the XMPP interface: it has been deprecated and there is no group chat support.  With the imminent shutdown of the XMPP interface, many users will be left in the dark.  And even with XMPP, the group chat functionality has been nonexistent.  In order to better support the platform for what people use it for, which is chatting, group chat support is essential.
