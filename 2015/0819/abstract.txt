The main goal of this project will be implementing an embedded Linux application in order to make a flexible use of the software and hardware parts of the FPGA-based System-On-Chip (SoC) architecture to develop function splitting in run time. The first function to be implemented will be the FFT as it is used widely in a different range of algorithms. In order to ease the process, current libraries that contain FFT implementations will be used.
