The aim of the project is to create an open hardware underwater vehicle based on BeagleBone Black. The project will involve using the OpenROV code base and the APM, to provide autopilot capabilities. ROS will be used as a bridge (mavros) to interface with the APM. The project will enable hobbyists to get access to a low cost, easy to use and open hardware underwater vehicle platform with autopilot capabilities which they can modify according to their needs and requirements.
