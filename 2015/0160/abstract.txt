The objective of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is to determine which sense of a word is meant in a particular context. Apache OpenNLP currently lacks a generalized WSD module, therefore, the purpose of this project is to design and implement this module. Since techniques can be either unsupervised or supervised, another target would be to implement algorithms of common unsupervised techniques, which could serve as examples for any future contributor willing to add and compare other approaches.
