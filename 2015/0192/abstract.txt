FOSSASIA is looking for two things, a) A mobile app for the FOSSASIA event, b) A event management utility  

I propose  a project that will combine both. I plan to build the project in three modules - 

 - an library which will contain all the extendable and reusable classes for creating the UI
 - A boilerplate-like wrapper app code that will use the aforesaid library. 
 - A webapp that will generate the data and config file that will be used be the wrapper code to form the event app.
