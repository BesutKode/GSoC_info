This projects aims for extending the capabilities of the existing workflow system of C-PAC with state of the art methods. The focus is set on the implementation of methods for the analysis of non linear time series (Lizier, Heinzle, Horstmann, Haynes, & Prokopenko, 2011; Razak & Jensen, 2013; Vicente, Wibral, Lindner, & Pipa, 2011) and graph theoretic approaches (Bullmore & Sporns, 2009; Lohmann et al., 2009;  Ralaivola, 2013) for the analysis of network metrics and network complexity measures.
