Theano is a popular library for defining and differentiating mathematical expression. Currently, Theano only supports static text and image output for debugging, which makes it hard to analyze complex models. Here, I propose to extend Theano by a module to interactively visualize graphs, which will assist debugging by dynamically a) arranging, collapsing, and editing of nodes, b) panning and zooming to different regions, and c) highlighting additional information by mouseover events.
