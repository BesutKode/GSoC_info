The goal of the Peace Corps Project â€˜Malaria Prevention' is to create a mobile app to help the Peace Corps Volunteers sustain protective practices against Malaria during their service at remote locations, which is quite essential since they are non-immune travellers. In my proposal, I have discussed ideas and functionalities that I wish to include followed by a detailed description of the implementation, design, deliverables, milestones and a realistic timeline split into work per week.
