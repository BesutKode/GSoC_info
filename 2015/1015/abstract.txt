The main components of astropython are forums, tutorials, a wiki of useful resources and storing of code snippets. It is currently slow, outdated and difficult to maintain.I wish to underline a comprehensive plan to revamp the website from its roots up making the application fast and easy to maintain and scalable across all devices.In addition to redesigning and revamping each of its original components,I propose certain new features that would be of tremendous productive value to the community.
