In modern sciences and technologies, Image processing has gained much broader scope due to the ever growing importance of scientific visualization.
Scilab provides excellent support in engineering sciences calculations but in the field of image processing it restricts the user to a small domain of functions and algorithms.

My aim is broadening this domain and providing users with an efficient and easily configurable  toolbox and hence making Scilab a preferable choice of tool for development
