The aim of this project is to provide to the python statsmodels library a GAM toolbox similar to the one available for R in the MGCV library. In addition GAM related methods from recent research results will be included in the library. The work will be mainly focused on the statistical inference and will make statsmodels and python an open source and more powerful alternative for practitioners that often rely on softwares like SAS or Stata.
