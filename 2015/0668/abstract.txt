My proposition as one of the active developers of PyWPS 4, an Python implementation of the Web Processing Service standard, is the implementation of a REST interface allowing for example the following but not limited to: 

* The ability for configuration of PyWPS and controlling of running processes 
* Getting a list of running processes 
* Possibility to pause/kill/resume running processes
* Import new processes into existing instances.
