Virtual European Mars Analog Station (V-ERAS) is based on immersive real-time virtual simulations running on top of the Blender Game Engine (BGE). This V-ERAS project has two distinct components. First, it entails the teleoperative control of the Robot rover's motion via human body-tracking. Second, it involves streaming the 3-D camera video feed from the rover to BGE over the network and processing it into an Augmented Reality experience through a head-mounted Virtual Reality device.
