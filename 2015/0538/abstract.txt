This project aims at adding a few extensions to the VTK library to support spline curve- and surface-based visualizations. In this project, we will focus on rational Bézier patches which are parametric surfaces generated from the Cartesian product of two Bézier curves, since isogeometric spline simulations of many different types can generate them. Supporting this widely-used parametric representation will give VTK the ability to visualize meshes and simulations processed from CAD models.
