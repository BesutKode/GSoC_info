The idea is to build user interface for the sTeam collaboration platform on top of the REST APIs which are already built and served.

Why sTeam?
sTeam is written using pike which have the capability of serving endpoints to Create/Read/Update/Delete (CRUD) documents all under one roof. As of the current interface interactions, non-REST APIs are used. sTeam is perfect as it supports almost all the functionality which we are looking for a collaboration platform.
