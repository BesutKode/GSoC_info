The first part of this project deals with cleaning up the the existing graph API. The functions returning both lists and iterators will be changed to return iterators and thus the _iter suffix will be retired. This will be followed by a cleanup and reorganising the existing codebase as required and decided, and getting it ready for the 2.0 release. The next part will be to design and implement a new unified graph API.
