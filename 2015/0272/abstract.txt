By proposing a specific joint interface of libctf and libkvm that would relay on the machine-independent information provided by the CTF and already existing access to the memory image, we aim to overcome the limitation of utilities such as ps or netstat when it comes to examining a crash dump that comes from a different platform. Furthermore, to demonstrate the functionality and usability of such library, a predefined set of basic userland utilities will be enhanced as a proof of concept.
