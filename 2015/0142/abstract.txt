GSoC is a thing that I have been always dreaming of. It is a unique opportunity to work with the best. Coding for GSoC will give me a huge experience. Projects proposed in GSoC are kind different from usual projects. I find them as important additions to the main projects, they are always open for discussion.
IntelliJ IDEA and Scala are my favourite coding tools. This project will be an excellent example of connection between passion and doing something useful for the others.
