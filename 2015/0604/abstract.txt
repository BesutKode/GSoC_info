Current enrol_meta plugin provides functionality to automatically synchronise enrolments between two courses. However, the user interface is inconvenient due to problems which include inability to bulk select and/or search courses, lacking functionality to synchronise suspended/expired enrolments. The project is to re-write the enrol_meta plugin such that one instance of the plugin should allow linking multiple courses and additionally synchronise each of them with a group in the meta course.
