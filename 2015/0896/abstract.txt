Since performance evaluation metrics for numerical optimization algorithms are important component for parameter tuning, comparing algorithms as well as characterizing and explaining the properties and behaviour of algorithms by statistical runtime comparisons. The BBOB testbed would be implemented to achieve this. PaGMO currently lacks new meta-heuristic algorithms hence the next part is to extend PaGMO by adding new meta-heuristic algorithms which are promising.
