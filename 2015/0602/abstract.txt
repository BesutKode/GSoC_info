Projection mapping has been common in art installations, but its techniques remain limited to skilled artists and computer scientists. This is because projection mapping involves tedious camera and/or projector calibration steps. Although there are projector-camera calibration and projection mapping tools implemented in openFrameworks and other frameworks, a standard API can be offered by OpenCV to avoid duplication in such tools.
