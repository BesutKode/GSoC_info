Ruby On Rails consists of a very powerful API called the File Checker API which serves the epic feature of dynamic reloading. This project deals with improving the current implementation as a substitute. The final output of the project will be an alternative to the existing File Checker that is, the Evented File System Monitoring gem which will be best optimized for the Rails framework.
