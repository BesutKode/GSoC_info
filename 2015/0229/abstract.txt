Viola-Jones Face Detection algorithm is one of the most successful algorithms in its field but it was patented and canâ€™t be safely used. This is why I propose to implement an algorithm according to a popular paper that has a slightly better performance and accuracy than the original Viola-Jones algorithm. It is similar to Viola-Jones algorithm but avoids the patent by using another features.
