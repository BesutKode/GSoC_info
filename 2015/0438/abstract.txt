Geophysical data visualization is a crucial part for the study of various areas of earth science, such as oil and mineral exploration, seismic monitoring etc. Related functions have been integrated into commercial software like Avizo, Open Inventor, Geoviz, etc. But in open source community, we still lack such software to provide solution for visualizing these kinds of data. In this project, I would like to add support for visualizing geophysical objects in VTK.
