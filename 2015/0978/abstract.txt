Aim of the project is to build iOS version of PeaceTrack's existing Android app. I plan on implementing this project from the scratch rather than building on the existing code of the iOS app coded in GSoC 2014, but will import already implemented features from the existing code. Final deliverable will  be fully functional and tested iOS app having the required features that will facilitate day-to-day data collection by Peace Corps Volunteers in the field.
