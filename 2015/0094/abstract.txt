BBBAndroid is mainly designed to enable users to run Android on our favorite embedded linux board (i.e. Beaglebone Black). "Demo Android app using BBBAndroid" project focuses on the demonstration of apps that can run on Android which makes use of some awesome peripherals support of the BeagleBone Black like ADC, GPIO, I2C, SPI, USB, CAN , PWM, UART etc. Future task could be to make simple APIs for interfacing BBB peripherals using NDK.
