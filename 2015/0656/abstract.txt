I am a third-year student of Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. I have never worked on open source project so I believe that it is a great opportunity for me to show what I can do. I am open-minded for task from this project that is why I would like to take part in contributing idea of implementing JOSM filters - I find it very attractive and interesting. I believe, I can show you good example of hard-working contributor and developer and you will never be regret if you apply myself.
