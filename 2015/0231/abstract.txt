WSO2 Machine Learner is a Server which provides Machine Learning on Big data. Wrangler [1] [2] is an interactive tool for data cleaning and transformation. Goal of this project is to add an extension for WSO2 Machine Learner for interactive data cleaning and transformation using Wrangler.

Proposed Solution is to extend the Wrangler to generate Spark Transformations and integrate it into WSO2 Machine Learner by importing as a Javascript library and develop a jaggery interface interact.
