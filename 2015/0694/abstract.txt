Memcached is a widely used CRUD protocol. MySQL provides a plugin, which allows to access and modify data in db via Memcached protocol instead of SQL. By using Memcached interface a far higher performance of simple db operations can be achieved [0]. Goal of this project is to port MySQL Memcached interface plugin to MariaDB. Furthermore, the plugin will be restructured in order to provide better access security (one table/port approach).
