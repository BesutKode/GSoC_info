This project improve the security and performance of OpenKeychain due to two reasons.
For security, the support of EdDSA is very important to enhance the security of OpenKeychain. There are no proof that ECDSA satisfy EUF-CMA which is a theoretical security model. EdDSA is based on Schnorr signature. Schnorr signature is EUF-CMA secure in the random oracle model.
For performance, EdDSA is faster than ECDSA in some point(e.g. key generation, verification, etc...).
