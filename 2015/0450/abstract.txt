Haskell is an advanced purely-functional programming language. Its current state is the result of many years of research providing many state-of-the-art features: strong static type system, great power of abstraction, parallelism support, amongst others. These features can benefit LibreOffice and provide an entry point for new developers and researchers. It allows to easily implement techniques that can provide, e.g., new paths to optimizations of algorithms with the use of multi-core CPUs.
