Jira for the Project - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STRATOS-1211

Currently Autoscaler component of the Stratos takes scaling up or scaling down decisions based on the health statistics from the CEP. But the statistics send from the CEP is not accurate. So this project aims on the improvement of the prediction algorithm of the Autoscaler, by introducing the curve fitting.
