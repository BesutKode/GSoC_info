Module details:https://www.drupal.org/project/print.
The present module lacks support for recent Drupal features such as generic entities and fields and also requires code refactoring due to presence of redundant code.
The proposed solution makes use of API's made available(mainly Plugin and Entity ) in Drupal 8 to make the architecture more stable and pre-processing on node's content more robust.The module will have to be renamed since Symfony prevents the use of the reserved keyword "print".
