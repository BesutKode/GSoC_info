GTFS-Realtime is one of the leading open standards for transmitting real time transit data.  But currently there are no open source validation tools for these feeds. 

The goal of the project is to develop an extensible GTFS-Realtime validator that is self contained. This can be used in the Open Trip Planner project as well as other projects using the feed format. 

The validation tool will take in a GTFS and GTFS-rt feeds as input and monitor and log errors and warnings on the said feeds.
