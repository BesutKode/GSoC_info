Currently, the open source GNSS-SDR is completely operational with GPS L1-C/A, Galileo E1 and E5a signals.
To go towards an effective multi-constellation software defined receiver, GNSS-SDR extension to the Chinese Navigation Satellite System (BeiDou) is proposed.
Hence, the aim of this project is to review and extend the functionality of the signal generator and signal acquisition of GNSS-SDR, implemented in C++ for the GPS and Galileo Signals, for BeiDou open service signals (B1l).
