Currently CMake build system in robocomp is limited only to the core libraries and some additional tools.The Goal of this project is to come up with a more suitable and efficient build system that could build the entire build system, without breaking their dependencies. I would also develop scripts which can provide a better interface for compiling individual components, running tests, search and inspect source tree efficiently,check dependencies and documentation requirements.
