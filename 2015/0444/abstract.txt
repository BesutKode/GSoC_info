Gnome-Logs is a viewer for the systemd journal. It's still heavily under development and not published with the Gnome Desktop Environment yet. The application is not very mature and some parts need further improvement and revision. I want to improve the application by implementing several new features, improving UI and fixing bugs that the application has, so that Logs can be published with Gnome Desktop Environment much sooner and more Gnome users can benefit from it.
