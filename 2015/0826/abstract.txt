ArUco board detection is fast, robust and can handle occlusion. The Charuco board combines the versatility of ArUco boards with the high corner refinement accuracy achieved by traditional chessboards patterns in order to obtain a less restrictive camera calibration procedure. This application includes the implementation of calibration based on Charuco board, detection of Super-Charuco markers and, finally, the development of an automatic and incremental calibration procedure.
