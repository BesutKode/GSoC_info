Dpkt is a Python library which provides a user-friendly interface to create and parse the network packets. The goal of the project is to improve the dpkt library. Firstly more test cases need to be added to expand the test coverage. Secondly we need to update the code to offer Python 3 support. Lastly some pending bugs or issues need to be solved. What’s more, if time permits, we’ll take time and effort to improve the project documentation.
