Thanks to swapping FreeBSD can run processes even if itâ€™s not possible to place new pages in memory. However, moving VM objects to and from secondary storage can be expensive. The goal of this project is to implement two features that will allow to remove duplicated pages and compress pages which can be well compressed. Both optimizations should increase VM performance and flash drives lifetime.
