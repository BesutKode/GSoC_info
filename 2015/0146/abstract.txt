Drupal is fairly secure by default, but there some security related settings that are up to the user. Security Review helps the webpage administrator find these configuration options, and ensures that they are set to their most secure setting, ranging from server related configuration to Drupal's itself.

The project goal is to port the Security Review module to Drupal 8, so that users will have an option for checking security configuration in the new version.
