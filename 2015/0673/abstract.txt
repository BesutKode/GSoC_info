Metaprogramming is about creating code that manipulates code. It has proven
to have useful applications in many areas, one of them is code refactoring â€“ the technique to improve the internal structure of a program.
The goal of this project is to create an automated refactoring framework for
scala.meta and to demonstrate its capabilities. This includes: organizing existing
scala.meta infrastructure, binding to popular IDEs, and developing some proof-of-
concept refactorings.
