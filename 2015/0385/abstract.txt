The project focuses on building a Privly Firefox extension on top of Mozilla’s Jetpack. Porting it to Jetpack would bring it to terms with the “Chrome” extension and would make further development easier. The project would include implementing several features such as Injecting content-scripts to replace privly-urls with Iframes, Opening “New-Message” from Context menus, Button in editable content areas for starting a Privly Post, Toolbar Pop-up Button, First-run start pages, etc.
