The project aims to port mailman.client to JavaScript, providing an API familiar to Node.js/IO.js developers, and finally ship it as a npm package for easy installation in a Node.js environment. The other main objectives would be to write a strong test suite for the developed Mailman JavaScript Client and writing API usage as well as design documentation for facilitating future work.
