Apport is a tool for detecting and reporting program crashes. In Debian, we would like to see Apport play flexible roles. In this project, we will improve its GUI, integrate it with Reportbug and Debian BST, and add offline support. Meanwhile, we will use smart ways to identify if candidate bug reports has been reported, fetch related reports and display them to users, aiming to make bug reporting and bug fixing more efficient and more user-friendly
