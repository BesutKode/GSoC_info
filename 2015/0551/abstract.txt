Processing is not a single programming language, but rather, an arts-oriented approach to coding in a variety of languages, including Java, JavaScript, and Python. Unfortunately, its pedagogically valuable Python Mode has been obsolesced by major structural changes to Processing's underlying implementation. I propose to update Python Mode so that it is fully compatible with the new Processing 3.0 codebase and IDE. Following this, I will revise and refresh its error-handling and documentation.
