These days one of the trending topic is Augmented Reality (AR) which blends computer graphics with the current reality combining both, our daily lives and technology in order to cover fundamental needs or simply for fun. In this proposal I will introduce a project to integrate to the Open Source Computer Vision libraries (OpenCV) a Structure from Motion module which will includes all the necessary tools and techniques to build AR or robotics applications.
