This project aims at facilitating a specific corpus annotation task, namely, tagging of multiword expressions. The goal of the project is to develop an integrated language-agnostic pipeline from user input of multiword expressions to a fully annotated corpus. The pipeline consists of the utility scripts that perform input and output conversion, the backend that communicates with the mwetoolkit (the tagger), and the frontend that allows the user to customize their tagging task.
