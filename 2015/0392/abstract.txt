Two solvers, one for single neurone calculations and one for chemical reaction- diffusion calculations, are two computationally demanding numerical engines. They are heavily used in MOOSE and they affects the overall computation efficiency.  Previously a basic GPU implementation has been done but its calculation doesnâ€™t give any speedup. A scalable and optimised GPU parallelisation algorithm needs to be implemented based on the previous work or re-invented from the serial CPU computation.
