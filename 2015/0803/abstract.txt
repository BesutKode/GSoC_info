Project aims to develop android application for a screening test for the detection of cancer bio-marker(s) from a small drop of blood. Many softwares exist for Blood sample image analysis, but most of them contain a trade-off between portability and accuracy. Using the state of art Image processing techniques and camera-equipped mobile devices with sufficient processing capacity, developing a reliable application that performs screening test for cancer biomarker detection is feasible.
