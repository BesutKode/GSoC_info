Main goal of the project is to integrate a GIS module to the generated web application. It will allow the users to display georeferenced forms on a map, pick a form from a map and list them. This tool will be capable to run in offline mode. Analysing georeferenced data is also as important as visualising it. Therefore, in addition to GIS module there will be a data analytics tool or query language which provides to run some data analysis algorithms to users such as nearest neighbours algorithms.
