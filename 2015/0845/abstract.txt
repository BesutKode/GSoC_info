This project proposes an implementation that would allow 'undo' operations in the Blocks editor. The Blocks editor allows an App Inventor user to build the control flow of the application being 'invented'. Currently, users have to rebuild or edit components in order to revert to previous states. The 'undo' operation proposed offers a one-step, user-friendly solution for reversing a fixed number of recent actions performed. The operation will sync with the Designer view in App Inventor.
