loklak is free software hosted on loklak.org which provides message search results from twitter in json format. loklak is a complete search engine back-end solution with a json api. What is missing to provide a search web page is a web page design showing the json search results as timeline in the style of a twitter search result. The data to be presented will all be within the json API of loklak. The timeline web page must also provide features like a twitter wall.
