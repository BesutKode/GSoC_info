I propose to implement a rolling update mechanism for LibreOffice based on Mozilla's rolling updater code. Doing this will help improve the LibreOffice user experience for users who want a convenient method of updating their software to get the latest and most secure versions of LibreOffice. My plan is to get all the relevant code pointers in the Mozilla updater code, and then convert them to be compatible with LibreOffice's existing update mechanism and locale support.
