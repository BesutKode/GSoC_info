Peace Corps Volunteers serving in Malaria endemic regions have a risk of contracting Malaria and are thus prescribed drugs to prevent contracting Malaria. However, there is the possibility that a PCV may forget to take their medication, which may lead to an increased risk of contracting Malaria. To help mitigate this possibility, Peace Corps has proposed a Malaria Prevention app to be utilized by PCVs on the field to give them reminders of when to take their medication.
