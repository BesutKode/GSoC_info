A lot of the people who contribute to Wikipedia or want to do so might not be as comfortable with the source wiki editor. Visual Editor provides a brilliant WYSIWYG interface, and with language proofing it should reduce the number of grammatical and spelling errors which are often overlooked in several re-edits. So far it does not have an integrated tool for language proofing. There are isolated tools in some wikipedia communities but there is no aggregated uniform implementation.
