The Goal of the Project is to extend the open source Brain Atlasing platform 'Scalable Brain Atlas' (SBA), with a service to upload a user MRI scan, register an SBA atlas template to it, decomposing the brain in up to a dozen anatomical regions, and create mesh files for these regions that are ready to be sent to a 3D printing service. The service will have the option to add pins and holes to the printed structures so that they can be clamped together after printing.
