I propose to build a robust, feature-rich interface between OpenCog and Minecraft, using ROS. The major components will be a Minecraft controller, a sensorimotor translator node in ROS, and a model of the world. Functionality will include pathfinding, the ability to construct and deconstruct the game world, and interaction with objects and entities. To test the interface, I will develop an AI in the AtomSpace that can process perceptual inputs and make decisions based on them.
