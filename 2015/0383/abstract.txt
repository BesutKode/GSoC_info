The Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (VDPAU) apart from hardware-accelerated decoding provides post-processing features including scaling, noise removal, a sharpening filter and most notably deinterlacing. This project aims to implement a filter to allow use of the postprocessing features as defined by the VDPAU API. All features will be usable thus allowing comparision of the quality and performance across different hardware and hardware vs. software.
