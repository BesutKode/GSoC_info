The syntax highlighting in MonoDevelop is done by defining a grammar as xml file to colorize tokens. Some highlightings are extended with hand written code. The highlighting system can be made faster (maybe with an on the fly compiler approach), more extensible (atm itâ€™s difficult to write semantic highlightings) and more scalable .
