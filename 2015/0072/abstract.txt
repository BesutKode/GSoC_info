The Table class is a central data structure in Astropy and is useful for manipulating tabular data. Therefore, adding indexing capability to Table would allow for increased efficiency in searching for individual rows in a table. My proposal will involve implementing indexing functionality for Table while ensuring that adding and removing records from each table works correctly in terms of the internal indexing system and that addition/removal operations suffer minimal slowdown due to indexing.
