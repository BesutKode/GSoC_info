The goal of this project is to develop an open-source backend for previewing email content on a range of different webmail services such as Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, and Microsoft Live.  We'll be using Selenium Webdriver, based on NodeJS, to implement browser automation on the backend. It will automatically send the email to accounts on these webmail services, which will then be logged in to, one by one, and screenshots will be taken. These screenshots will be displayed to the user on the frontend.
