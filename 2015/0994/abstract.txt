Deep neural networks show significant accuracy increase in image classification and many other tasks.
Modern DNN frameworks deliver efficient training methods, but most of them use different architecture serialization and weights storage scheme. These research frameworks have cross-platform issues and cannot be easily embedded into existing programs.
OpenCV must have a simple interface for DNN networks with effective cross-platform realization and importers for the most popular DNN frameworks.
