DataCat is the software outcome of a final year research and development project done by a group of undergraduate students (including myself) from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka [1]. In brief it is a data cataloging system which can catalog scientific data products, specially which get generated in computer simulation applications running in a cyber infrastructure. The goal of this project is to integrate DataCat system with Apache Airavata and deploy it in production GridChem system [2].
