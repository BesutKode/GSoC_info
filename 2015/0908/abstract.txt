Email customizer is a powerful feature which can be used by instructors to send customized emails to multiple students. Each email has the same kind of information, yet some of the content is unique. For example, an instructor can send an email informing that the marks for an exam are released. The common message requests students to verify their marks. Each email is personalized and contains a studentâ€™s individual marks. The unique information in each email comes from entries in a spreadsheet.
