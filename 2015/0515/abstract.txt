The framework proposed will implement speaker diarization module for a massive heterogeneous television news corpus and pre-processing steps which will allow a user to use it’s own segmentation information or can use auto-segmentation. Another contribution is to make a speaker identification module within a network using technique called “Constrained Global Clustering” across video files. This framework will be then compiled with open-source toolKit called “voice-id” to use Multi-Modal approach.
