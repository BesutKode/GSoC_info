Tumor heterogeneity (TH) is the phenomena whereby tumor cells display distinct biological differences despite deriving from the same origin and is link to cancer progression. Genome sequencing have provided in the study of (TH) in cancer. Still, study of these data is hindered by the lack of easy to use visualization tools  This project aims to develop tools that combine genomic data from time course experiments, scientific literature and patient data, visualized in a concise way.
