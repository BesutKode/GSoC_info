This project would extend time series analysis in Statsmodels by making use of the new Statespace module, which currently allows creation and estimation of arbitrary models by end-users but only SARIMAX as a built-in class. It would add: Unobserved components, Vector autoregression, Dynamic factors, and either the Fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average or Minnesota / Litterman priors for VARs. It will improve standard errors and add diagnostic statistics and linear constraints.
