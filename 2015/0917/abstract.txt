Here I propose to design and implement a prototype data warehouse for storing analyzed cancer genomic data, together with a RESTful web service for retrieving data from the warehouse. Since genomic data tend to be variable and complex, document-oriented databases are well suited for this project. I plan to perform data modeling, and implement this model in MongoDB, SciDB, and Couchbase. Furthermore, I will use Spring to implement a REST API and conduct performance tests on of these databases.
