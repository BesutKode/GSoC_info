syslog-ng is powerful log management solution with many log processing features, but if it is not enough, it can be extended with new modules written in C. However C is not the language for rapid development,. To overcome this problem, a Java destination is already available in syslog-ng-incubator. The goal of this project is to extend this functionality, and make it possible to write filters, parsers, rewrite rules, template functions, and even sources in Java.
