The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive and extensible model for describing Clojure sources from an API perspective. I will also write a program that analyses Clojure  sources according to this model and outputs data documenting their usage. In order to foster adoption, I will provide extensive documentation, including examples of tools doing useful things with the emitted data, and emphasize active communication with the community.
