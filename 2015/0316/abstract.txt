WSO2 Complex Event Processor is a real time analytic engine that support SQL like queries. 
Idea of the project is to build a visual composer for Siddhi language that provides a palette of 
operators and let users drag and drop those operators to a canvas and visually compose queries.
WSO2 will provide a JSON description of operators, and the project involve developing a palette
initialised with those operators and develop the canvas for visually composing queries.
