This project is an implementation of an approach to the unsupervised extraction of dependency grammars and syntax-to-semantic-relationship mappings from a large text of corpora. This project, if successful would enable the mining of all the information needed for a natural language comprehension system from a large, unannotated corpus. It is based on a paper written by Linas Vepstas and Benjamin Goertzel.
