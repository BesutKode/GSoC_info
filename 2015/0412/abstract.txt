CSymPy is a fast symbolic manipulation library written in C++. Sage uses Pynac as its main symbolic engine. CSymPy is much faster than what is already there at Sage. Several benchmarks from http://wiki.sagemath.org/symbench run on CSymPy suggests that CSymPy is 6 times or more faster. A big long term goal would be to have CSymPy become the default symbolic manipulation engine of Sage and this GSoC project proposes to have it as an alternative symbolic manipulation engine for Sage
