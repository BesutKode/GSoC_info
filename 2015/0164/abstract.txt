Improving the compile-time of polyhedral compilation tools and Polly has been an issue for some time. However, recently, lot of progress has been made. The aim of this project is to improve the compile-time of Polly by a large-factor. Some of the prominent changes I plan to make are: changes to the representations in the Integer Set Library (ISL) that Polly uses, and to modify the position of Polly in LLVM pass pipeline and itâ€™s interactions with other passes.
