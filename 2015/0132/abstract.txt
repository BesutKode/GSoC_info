TLD tracker is a novel tracking framework that utilizes a power of online learning and structural information of image to build a robust and accurate long-term object tracker. The proposed project aims to extend/improve the existing implementation of OpenCV TLD to a multi-object tracker, that inherits all main features of original TLD algorithm, so it can be used to track and learn previously unknown objects in a video stream and redetect them in case of tracking failure.
