Geography Markup Language(GML) is a XML encoding for representing geographical features. It is an OGC standard and an open data interchange format on the internet. The scope of this project is not support for entire GML schema but a Simple Feature Profile(SFP). It is a subset of the entire schema and provides only the basic and essential features. Web Feature Service(WFS) has native support for SFP and therefore, this project will be a stepping stone for implementation of WFS in cesium.
