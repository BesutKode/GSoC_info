Implementation of an API to provide OAUTH2 as an SASL mechanism for LightMelody is the aim of this project.  This involves the implementation of an OAUTH2 server and client, and an XMPP server and client.  The clients will be implemented together as part of a LightMelody API, and the servers will be created separately.  An HTTPS server API will be made for LightMelody for the OAUTH2 client.  The XMPP server will be built upon Prosody.
