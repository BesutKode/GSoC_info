MoinMoin is a wiki engine written in Python. MoinMoin 2.0 is currently in  development and there's a lot to be improved in UI/UX of the wiki.
Wiki interface can sometime be intimidating to new users. UI plays an important part in helping newcomers understand our interfaces.
The aim is to make controls easier to understand for a user unfamiliar with the interface.
The tweaks will provide a better UI and better user experience for the wiki users.
