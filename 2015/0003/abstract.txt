Ability to stage content is a highly desired feature in many circumstances. One of the most important component of this content staging system is the replicator, which is responsible for managing the transfer of the content between sites. I would primarily be working on this component and it will be based on the CouchDB Replication Protocol. It will be integrated into Drupal with a Drush plugin and a simple UI.
