The aim of this project it to develop Haskell bindings for the main interface of the OpenCog software.
Existing bindings for Python an Scheme are in use. It is possible to write Cognitive processes in these languages, and interact with the efficient C++ OpenCog core. So, we aim to have comparable Haskell bindings.
