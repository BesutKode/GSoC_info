The goal of this project is creating a tool for managing data migration scripts based on Slick. The idea is roughly similar to migrations/evolutions in Ruby on Rails or Scala Play 2. We will need to significantly improve (or re-write) the code of a proof of concept implementation to make it production ready, extend it by futher features and explore some exciting ideas like reliable migrations in a development scenario with branches (like git branches).
