Current GRASS GIS offers ISO-based Metadata support. This package includes three modules designed to generate, create and edit metadata. The goal of this work consist of two main parts. First aim is to improve current package by adding a few functionality for extend metadata handling. The second goal is to implement module for interaction with metadata catalogue services (CSW). Additional benefit of this part allows access of metadata between GRASS GIS and QGIS (MetaSearch plugin).
