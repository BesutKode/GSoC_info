Currently, Python implementation of P2PSP protocol doesn't contain Content Integrity Set of rules (CIS). This set of rules allows to mitigate the pollution attacks (where the content is modified by an attacker). There is two variants of this set of rules, both are based on Third Trusted Party. The aim of this project is to implement both variants of CIS of rules for Python implementation of P2PSP, and to try to suggest CIS of rules without Third Trusted Party.
