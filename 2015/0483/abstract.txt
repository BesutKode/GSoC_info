Most of the objectives clearly defined on the project's page are about data representation and UI capabilities and other tasks about moving all previous legacy module pages to be developed on the UI Framework, and modeling a custom indexing way that may support other non patient searches such as module's data In addition to supporting more patient data such as allergies, appointments. This is why we need another phase that's aimed at reaching full thought-of functionality support.
