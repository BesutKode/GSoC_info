Wikimedia projects and developers could use an extra hand when it comes to communicating the recent activities to the community as well as to the outside. The best possible solution we have at hand is a Newsletter, which brings together all the relevant news/updates at one place. This is where the idea of a newsletter extension comes in, allowing any number of wikis to install the feature and deliver the latest updates to users through a subscription.
