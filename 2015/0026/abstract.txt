Cesium Sandcastle is a very useful tool to learn and develop Cesium applications. However, since it was one of the earliest Cesium applications written, it was developed in Dojo and lacks responsive design. This project aims to make Sandcastle mobile-ready, and remove it's dependency on Dojo, as well as add a few more features to the Sandcastle application to make it more powerful and useful.
