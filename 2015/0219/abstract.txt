In this project, I'll work on improving current Linguist's detection performance. There are some problems need to tackle on in order to increase the accuracy. For example, we should be able to detect novel class (e.g. "unknown") in the prediction stage. Also, implementing some new classifiers and blending with current strategies should give a better accuracy. I hope this project can help GitHub and other linguist users to achieve a more accurate language detection.
