Connector/C and server support for dynamic columns needs import and export methods for dealing with popular data formats like JSON, XML, GML and other variants. Using arrays  as dynamic column is a good workround for users. This project will add support for arrays as a dynamic column value,  extend Connector/C to include a library of functions to import and export popular data formats from/to dynamic columns as well as providing user defined functions to provide the same functionality in server.
