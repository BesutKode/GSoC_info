RIOT-OS is an operating system for embedded devices.   Embedded devices which are expected to have low energy consumption as well as to work in almost any environment. Some of these devices may operate in hard-to-reach or far-off fields but still need software updates from time to time. Currently, RIOT applications are compiled with the RIOT-OS into a single binary and flashed manually. The idea behind  this project is to use dynamic linking in order to enable software updates.
