I would like to develop an external facelist module in the VTK-m toolkit.  Specifically, I am considering two ideas for the external faces problem, using data parallel primitives: traditional hashing and a sorting-based hashing approach.  For these two approaches, I will conduct a set of experiments, spanning multiple architectures and data sets.  Finally, I will focus on the more-efficient method, productize it, and contribute it back to VTK-m.
