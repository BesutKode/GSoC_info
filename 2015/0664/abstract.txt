Random number generation is vital for cryptography, non-deterministic algorithms or modelling. With cheap multicore processors, the language which utilizes the given resources without compromising the properties of the generated pseudorandom numbers and achieving maximum speedup is more likely to be used for computation-intensive industrial applications. However, the current standard library splittable generator has performance and correctness flaws which the following proposal is to address.
