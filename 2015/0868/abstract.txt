This project aims at updating the existing "Blender and MBDyn" for the new Blender 2.6+ Python API. This would involve defining the GUI as per the new API standards, porting over the existing functionalities over to the new tool, as well as improving many existing features. The project also aims at updating the tool with the recently added elements to the MBDyn element library. The project also aims at implementing the support of NetCDF format in the tool.
