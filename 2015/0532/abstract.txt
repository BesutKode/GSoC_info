The project aims to implement a graphical tool which functionality includes extracting modules from BIOS images, adding and deleting components of coreboot ROM image file and flashing. It will be achieved by integrating code of already existing tools: flashrom (libflashrom), bios_extract and cbfstool. Thus that end user will be allowed to easily select desireable payload and flash firmware just by clicking few application buttons.
