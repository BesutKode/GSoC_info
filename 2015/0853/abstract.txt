We plan to give a efficient frontend to FPROPS by implementing a Tabulated Taylor Series Expansion. We expect this implementation to reduce the computation time as bulk of the time is moved to allocating and building the table. After that, successive calls to evaluate some thermodynamic state property can be efficiently calculated by looking up into the table and doing very few arithmetic operations to get the result.
