CERN’s SixTrack 6D Tracking Code is used to compute and simulate the trajectories of rel- ativistic charged particles in circular accelerators. However, there are certain maps in SixTrack’s Physics Manual that have not yet been implemented within the SixTrack 6D Tracking Code. This project aims to implement these maps in simulator’s native language Fortran, for use in the SixTrack simulator, and check each map within SixTrack’s Physics Manual for physical correctness and numerical stability.
