The openGL implementation Mesa (part of the Linux graphics stack) has just gotten a new ir, NIR. NIR will allow for implementing a lot of the common optimization passes in the way they are represented in research papers, since it is SSA. NIR shows great potential, and lot of good work has been done. There are still optimization passes that could be ported from GLSL ir. I seek to implement a range analysis pass for NIR, among others.
