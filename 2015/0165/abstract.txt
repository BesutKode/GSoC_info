During the program, I intend to develop a centralized dashboard for Postorius, which would be used by owners and moderators of multiple lists to easily handle subscription requests and held messages, all from one location. The project primarily focuses on grouping of various tasks related to pending moderations, requests and lists management to a single page, while emphasizing priority actions that need to be taken by the role holders.
