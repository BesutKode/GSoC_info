Software Carpentry is growing rapidly. All the management for its workshops is currently being done by 1-2 persons and in very rough conditions (via files and text notes). That's why Amy was created: to help Software Carpentry admins schedule workshops, assign instructors to workshops, and even coordinate training for new instructors.

The aim of this project is to continue enhancing Amy. Many people suggested great ideas for Amy, some even implemented them, but not much was actually merged.
