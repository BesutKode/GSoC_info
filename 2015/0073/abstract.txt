Implement Kriging interpolation in the core raster library (operating in a single threaded environment). The implementation would comprise building the Geo-Kriging model, in the sequence of Ordinary Kriging Model, the Universal Kriging model and then finally the Geo-Kriging model. Scope for a distributed version of the implementation so that a large collection of points in space could be turned into a collection of rasters in a distributed manner, using Spark enabled with GeoTrellis.
