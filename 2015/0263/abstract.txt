OpenMRS ID is the user account management system that underlies all services on OpenMRS.org. It provides single-sign-on access to the Wiki, OpenMRS Talk, JIRA, the Modules directory, and other services. It also publishes the ID Dashboard, a frontend interface where users can sign up for an ID and modify their profile information.
This project will tackle some of the new features and ideas we have for OpenMRS ID.
