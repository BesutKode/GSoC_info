digiKams strong point is the the ability to organize and manage large collections  of photos using metadata stored in files. To perform tasks faster, certain data is stored in the internal database. To keep images and database in sync, digiKam feature basic read and write methods. The goal of this proposal is to extend the current read/write functionality to be more robust and easier to configure.
