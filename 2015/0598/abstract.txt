My project proposal is the development of a privacy testing tool for mobile applications. The aim of this tool is to identify common network based privacy threats in mobile applications, with the target audience being Android mobile developers. 
Privacy tools exist for users of mobile applications to detect privacy threats and some provide options to prevent personal data disclosure. However, there is a lack of tools available for mobile application developers to detect privacy issues.
