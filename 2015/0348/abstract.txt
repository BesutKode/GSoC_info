I propose to implement Generalized Linear Mixed Models for Statsmodels. The ultimate goal would be to have something comparable to glmer in R. This will utilize existing GLM and MLE frameworks in Statsmodels. The project will be a success if stable results matching other packages can be obtained for commonly used models. Performance optimization and post-estimation will not be completed but the results of this project will serve as a foundation for future high-capability mixed GLM procedures.
