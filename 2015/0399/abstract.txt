AeroGear WebPush is a proof of concept implementation of the WebPush Protocol specification. It allows to maintain a single HTTP/2 connect which can service as many client applications as needed. It also enables the service worker to receive notifications even if the target application of those notifications is not currently active. It would be perfect to add support for mobile cloud services and try it with IoT devices!
