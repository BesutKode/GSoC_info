The IDA solver requires more refinements both in the numerical as well as user-facing aspects is desirable. One important issue is to do with EVENT syntax - which helps to model whole range of systems, in which parametric constants themselves change values with triggered events, or even more sophisticated systems in which constraint equations are added or deleted when a given event is triggered. This project attempts to strengthen the functionalities of the IDA solver.
