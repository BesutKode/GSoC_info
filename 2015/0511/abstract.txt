RouteFlow currently lacks of unified testing modules that can verify the status and behavior of all its components. Besides not only verifying them it is necessary to verify a rounting scenario where virtual routers are created and insert routes into dataplane switches with the required configuration iniatially defined. This project will focus on the verification of all the components of RouteFlow and also on the definition of testing use cases for all the behavior of the routing platform.
