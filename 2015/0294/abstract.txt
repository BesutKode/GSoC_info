My proposal is about the VXQuery issue of retrieving data from HDFS and adding a YARN cluster management system. I explain my ideas of how I will deal with these problems and how much time I believe I will need for each one. In addition I propose another feature for VXQuery that I believe can help make the project more useful. That is making VXQuery available as a module for Hadoop.
