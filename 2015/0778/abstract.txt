Entity Embed module provided certain API level plugins, forms etc. which should be abstracted out to a separate module in order for other modules to also use it. Hence the idea of this project is to abstract the buttons, embed form, and display plugins from entity_embed into a generic "Embed" module that can be used by both entity_embed, url_embed, and other embeddables in Drupal 8.
