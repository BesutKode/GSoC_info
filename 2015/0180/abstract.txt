During GSoC 2014 PMC was ported to KDE Frameworks 5 and QtQuick2. Also PMC now can be loaded by plasmashell as shell package. This proposal aims to provide TV optimized dashboard support for the PMC. Currently PMC shell package is using desktopcontainment for loading and interacting with plasmoids which is highly dependent on the mouse for its operations. This proposal aims to eliminate this limitation and provide containment interface which can work with remote control/keyboard.
