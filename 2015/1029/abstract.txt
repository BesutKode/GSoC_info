This project aims at implementing a new version of the ARPACK library using modern C++ language, and integrating it with R through the RcppArmadillo interface. ARPACK is widely used to solve large scale eigenvalue problems, but it was written in the antique Fortran 77 language and its development has been inactive for a long time. This project tries to rewrite its main functionality and redesign the API, so that R, as well as other programs, can easily interface to this library.
