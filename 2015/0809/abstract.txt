pgRouting is a software which provides geospatial routing functionality which needs data to work upon and OSM data is the most popular road network data.
We want to use OSM data more frequently and effectively in this software via 'osm2pgRouting' tool. There is a current implementation of this tool which can be improved with various new features added to it.
We will use OSRM EXTRACT procedure and configuration settings to import OSM data into our existing PostGreSQL database
