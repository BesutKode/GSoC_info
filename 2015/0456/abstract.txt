The goal of this project is to port MicroMonitor to the Beaglebone Black as an effort to replace the more license-restrictive U-boot for system initialization and application booting.  Undertaking this effort aligns with the RTEMS project perspective and will pave the way for future efforts in extending MicroMonitor towards other Beagle platforms as well as to other platforms and architectures.
