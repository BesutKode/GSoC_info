Diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) is a non-invasive technique that allows mapping of brain connections and quantification of tissue properties in vivo. Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging (DKI) is a new dMRI modality that overcomes the limitations of the dMRI techniques most widely used by the medical community. The objectives of this project is to implement DKI modules in Dipy. My vision is to improve the reliability and reproducibility of DKI studies by providing the first open source DKI modules.
