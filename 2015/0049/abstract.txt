Currently ASCEND has limited number of pre-defined models that are relevant to the field of Chemical Engineering. This narrows down the applicability of ASCEND and highlights the need for developing simple and important process models in ASCEND. Also, with the development of these process models, a new need for flash algorithms will also be created. . The thermodynamic supports in ASCEND also needs to be broadened.
