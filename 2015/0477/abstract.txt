`git branch -l`, `git tag -l` and `git for-each-ref` are all about selecting a set
of refs and printing the result. Currently, each has their own implementation 
and options. This results in some of them having selection options and others
having formatting options. 
I propose to build a common library so that all three commands have common options
and use the library extensively throughout their code.
