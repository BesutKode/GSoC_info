jBPM is a flexible Business Process Management (BPM) Suite which can be accessed by a web based workbench. But cannot be accessed by mobile users. Therefore the idea of the project is to create a mobile UI of the jBPM-console where mobile users can interact some of the features of the jBPM-console. 
The jBPM core engine itself is a lightweight workflow engine which can be run on android as well. Therefore apart from the mobile UI, a prototype of jBPM on android will be also created.
