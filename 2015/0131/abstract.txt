Currently, the ffmpeg project hosts an incomplete implementation of an AAC encoder. This encoder has features missing, along with being lower quality than alternative free and non-free implementations. To be able to compete with such implementations of the AAC format, there are features that need to be implemented: perceptual noise substitution, intensity stereo, and others. The aim is to implement these features inside ffmpeg's AAC encoder such that eventually it could be considered stable.
