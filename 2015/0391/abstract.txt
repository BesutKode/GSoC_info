Two core components will be implemented, i.e. the Visual Odometry, which is responsible for Kinect tracking to get accurate pose of every frame(also loop closure); the Dense Mapping, in which all the depth and color frames will be aligned to a global coordinate, using a pose graph(maybe TORO) to achieve best results by optimization. After point cloud reconstruction done, meshing and other post-processing can be done to achieve beautiful models.
