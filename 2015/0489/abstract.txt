Animint is an R package for making interactive animated data visualizations on the web using ggplot syntax.  This project will enhance the current package in several ways: allowing the user to interact with the legends, adding fragment identifiers to the animations, and improving the Animint documentation.  These improvements will help Animint be a more powerful and accessible tool for R programmers.
