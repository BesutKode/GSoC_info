Elasticsearch is very good and scalable search engine. It provides a REST API accessed though JSON format. There have been many clients written in different languages(php, js, python, ruby, etc.) to wrap around the REST API.
There has been no client for lua.
My project aims to create an elastic-search client in Lua.
