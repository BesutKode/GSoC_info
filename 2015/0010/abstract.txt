Unfortunately, there are no good libraries that provides good crossplatform video/desktop capture, so all Tox clients hace to implement their own ways of doing these things. So if somebody will write new client, he have to write video/screen capturing from the beginning. I feel strongly that the most important step is to fix the audio/video/desktop capture support, because the visual and audio communication is essential.
