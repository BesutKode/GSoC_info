Currently, there exists a Google Chrome and a Firefox extension for Privly. The Safari extension has to be built from scratch as the existing one is outdated. The aim of the extension will be to identify privly identifiable links and, inject locally served privly applications. For the project, PlainPost and ZeroBin injectable applications has to be added to the extension so that they donâ€™t have to have to execute remote code.
