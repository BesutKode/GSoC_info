This Proposal concerns Peruse-A-Rue; Street View for Liquid Galaxy application. The project contains two parts:

1. Addition of a new random panorama feature to Peruse-a-Rue that allows random panoramas within certain limits, similar to www.geoguessr.com and www.mapcrunch.com.

2. Migrating the master display code to run on the touchscreen client, hiding the delay currently seen between the visible master and slave displays. This will also allow a current heading to be shown easily.
