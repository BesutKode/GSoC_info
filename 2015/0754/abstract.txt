The proposed project aims to deliver a skin for thug ie. Rumal which will make it possible to run analysis as well as collaborate on results.The aim of the platform would be not only to be a web GUI but also to act as a social network so that data (willingly shared) from many users can be used to find common patters and allow better collaboration.The portal will use the API exposed by ThugD, and will also benefit from integration with external analysis tools to enrich the data.
