1. Integrate the two search options available on two different pages .

The user will be able to search on the data indexed in solr( currently accessed through the eol.org/search) as well as the virtuoso data( eol.org/data_search) in just one page.

2. Summarizing the RDF graphs for enhanced query performance.


This will result in the query being fired  just in the summarized RDF graph and so instead of querying the whole dataset,the queries are executed on the summarized graphs.
