“coala is a simple COde AnaLysis Application. Its goal is to make static code analysis easy while remaining completely modular and therefore extendable and language independent”.					

The goal of my proposal is to implement a GUI for coala and presents an easy to use interface to the user. It has the ability to make coala configuration files to trigger runs using them. It will also show the logs. It will be implemented using PyGTK3.
