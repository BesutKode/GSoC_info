In this project I will focus on implementing several real time dense stereo reconstruction algorithms with accurate sub pixel estimation. The implemented block matching will be based on LBP, Modified Census, CS-Census, BRIEF, RT and RBM (relaxing the fronto-parallel constraint using census). For sub-pixel implementation I will use quadratic interpolation and I will also want to implement a symmetric V approach since the last gives better results at good speed.
