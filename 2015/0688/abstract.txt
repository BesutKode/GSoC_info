For entity disambiguation, DBpedia Spotlight uses a vector model to evaluate similarities between contexts and candidate entities. Word2Vec, GloVe and other models might be very effective replacements for the currently used discrete context vector model. This is a proposal for extending Spotlight to include some these more advanced models and to evaluate if they lead to better disambiguation.
