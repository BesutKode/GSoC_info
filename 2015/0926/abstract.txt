I plan on improving qTox usability in order to bring it on par with Skype and other clients. As such, I hope to introduce a few new features into the qTox client that other clients have. These include: Friends list improvement including groups and searching, a recent list with a new start up window, Improved chatform, support for dialog windows, rather than having all chats in a single window and improving audio and video input and out.
