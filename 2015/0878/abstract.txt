Gnome-clocks is one of the very basic applications of GNOME providing basic four functionalities: 
World clock, Alarm, Timer, Stopwatch.
Out of these four modules, world clock and alarm need redesign and few extra features like time-conversion, alarm labeling etc..
Timer module currently doesn’t support multiple timers functionality. “Multiple-timers” is one of the main features. 
Stopwatch doesn't require much modifications.
