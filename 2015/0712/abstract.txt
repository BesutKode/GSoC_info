jor1k is an emulator for the OpenRISC platform and is the fastest emulator which runs in the web browser and boots Linux. At the highest level of abstraction main objective of the project would be to port jor1k to support RISC-V Architecture. Goals include booting Linux successfully, providing a web interface to test the compiled binaries, providing a demo file system with some major tools and adding support to some of the features of lowRISC such as minion cores.
