The deformable part-based model (DPM) proposed by P. Felzenszwalb et al has been seen as a milestone in object detection. OpenCV provides a C++ implementation of DPM (aka LatentSVM detector) but still needs more improvement. The goal of this project is,  (1) to refactor the code and improve the detection speed; (2) to add Octave training code for open source users. This work is expected to provide a fast and state-of-the-art detector in OpenCV, which could benefit a large number of users.
