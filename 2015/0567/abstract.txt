The Python API of MLlib has a few important features missing as when compared to the Scala backend. My project involves addition of these features, fixing related issues and improvement of the Scala backend as well.

The more important of these features include
1. Support save / load across all models.
2. Support for evaluation metrics
3. Support for streaming ML algorithms.
4. Support for distributed linear algebra
5. Simplifying API using DataFrames.
