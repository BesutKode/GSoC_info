Peer-to-peer connections are popular, as they allow to save bandwidth and remove the need for centralized servers. If both peers are behind a NAT device / router, UPnP and the IGD protocol are necessary. They are (being) implemented in P2PSP, however both need prior configuration in one of the NAT devices. This project is dedicated to implement NAT traversal via hole punching without prior configuration. It is implemented in Python as a new Set of Rules inheriting existing classes.
