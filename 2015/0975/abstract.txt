BRL-CAD uses CSG in order to perform operations (e.g. union, intersection,
subtraction) with primitives. I propose to design a new, higher performance,
implementation of the boolean weaver component which is used to implement
CSG. The idea is to minimize branch divergence and perform static and runtime
expression optimizations in order to further reduce the time required to perform
the CSG operations and thus render scenes more quickly.
