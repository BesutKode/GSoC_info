As a part of the project, I will be creating an API for PySoy developers to integrate statistics and server administration to their game server / client architecture with ease. I will also be designing a web based control panel to view the statistics and also control the game server. Since there is no existing support for statistics logging, it will provide an easy way to generate useful analytics of the game servers.
