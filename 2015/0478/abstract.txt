A Definitional Tree is a hierarchical structure of the rules defining an operation in a program. For investigating and experimenting with evaluation strategies and compilation techniques for a program it is convenient to start with a definitional tree without the machinery and complexity of a compiler. Unfortunately, building a definitional tree by hand is a lengthy and tedious process. This project aims at building a tool for easily constructing a definitional tree for a given function.
