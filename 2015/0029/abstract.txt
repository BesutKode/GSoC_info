The goal of this project is to polish Boxes to make it as close to perfection as possible. To achieve this, I'll:
- port its installation wizard to GtkAssistant and polishing it,
- improve its usage of MIME-types,
- try to find as much undiscovered bugs as I can,
- polish the GUI and get rid of as much small bugs as possible in the form of a hardening sprint,
- add tests for the bugs I fix.
