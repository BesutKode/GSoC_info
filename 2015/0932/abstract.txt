The processing community uses extensively the Kinect for interactive applications, art installations and scientific research. The only library that supports the Kinect v2 is the KinectPV2. I propose adding new functionalities and bug corrections to the library. However, the library only works on Windows. Therefore, I proposed to update openKinect to be able to work with the Kinect via libfreenect2 and as well extend Kinect on web applications, enabling easy use of the Kinect across all OS.
