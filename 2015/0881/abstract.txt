Offering OpenStreetMap (OSM) support is crucial for the further development of Marble as it is one of the main geographical data providers out there. It would fill a gap in Marble's reliability and would certainly add one more useful tool to the "Swiss army knife". Moreover, refactoring existing code in Marbleâ€™s plugins and libraries is bound to be one essential goal, as it would greatly improve the overall code quality and robustness.
