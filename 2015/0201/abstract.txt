The project aim is to implement layered Grammar of Graphics, in Haskell using Diagrams as back-end.The core ideas is to start with the raw data and think about all the transformations, statistics, etc. that go into graphing it. With a good framework, this can help us see connections between different graphs and create new ones.Youâ€™ll realize that a pie chart is basically just a stacked bar chart plotted in polar coordinates, with bar height mapped to pie-slice angle.
