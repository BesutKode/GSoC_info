Raspberry Pi is a series of popular, low-cost credit card-sized single-board computers, based on an ARM cpu, with the intention of promoting the teaching of basic computer science in schools. It would be great for both the project and RTOS education  if RTEMS can have a full support on raspberry pi. The goal of the project is to improve the RTEMS board support packages for Raspberry Pi.
