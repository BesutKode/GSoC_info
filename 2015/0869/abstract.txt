The proposed project aims to port Pysoy rendering cycle from openGL(ES 2.0) to webGL using Emscripten library enabling it to run independently on all web and mobile browsers. 

Modifying build functionality of PySoy to support the transition, marking relevant code for porting and adding build support for conditional compilation to waf. Further I shall work to integrate emcc with the current waf build as currently there is no support. Lastly widgets for webGL support in Pysoy would be added.
