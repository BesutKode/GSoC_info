This project aims to adapt the Gazebo framework to simulate the RoboCup soccer environment. As a test bed, a sample soccer agent will be developed, so that its main task is to walk through the ball, and dribble the ball.  Walking is the most challenging task in humanoid soccer robots, and having the well-established walk engine library can be interesting, and it can be seen as an initiative framework for other researchers who are willing to develop their project by Gazebo simulator.
