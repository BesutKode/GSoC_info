In the following proposal I lay out a plan to implement the checker framework idea, from the ideas page.

In this particular version this means:
Refactoring, breaking up the current problem reporter plugin's code and moving it into the shell. Reusing the problem model in error checker plugins, and integrating their views on a unified widget. Implementing new error checker plugins with the new framework.
