VTK has a distributed data filter to partition data in non-overlapping pieces. Another more efficient implementation, which uses zoltan library, is done by pv-zoltan plugin of vtk. First part of this project is to re-implement same plugin filters using newer zoltan2 library. Second part  involves, identification of ghosts cells, writing unit tests and exploring possible algorithms related to ghosts cells. Last part is to write multithreaded code to utilize all cores on node in partitioning.
