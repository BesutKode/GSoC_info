The objective is to implement a new IDE plugin for Eclipse (and if there is time, Intellij IDEA) which performs architecture error checking on code while on a local machine. The code analysis will be done with Archnemisis and annotate any violations that occur while developers are working on their code. The new plugin will ensure that potentially problematic issues are caught early and fixed before they are built upon and cause issues later down the line.
