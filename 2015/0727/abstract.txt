The main objective of this project would be to extend the game theory component of sage. This would be carried out in three parts, solvers and game generators and game classes. For the first part I would like to integrate the solvers within gambit for N-player games as well as the LH algorithm within sage. Also an implementation of game generators capable of generating different instances given a family of games and finally, the addition of a class of polymatrix games.
