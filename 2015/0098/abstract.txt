Matrix Functions are widely used to describe dynamical systems, this project aims at implementing those based on algorithms developed at the University of Manchester by Dr. Philip Davies and Matthew Smith, led by Prof.  Nick Higham. Upon completion Gnu Octave should have a reliable working funm based on the Schur-Parlett algorithms by Higham et al., that calls to specific matrix functions if these have an instance of their own.
