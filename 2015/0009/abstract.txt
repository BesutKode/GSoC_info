Currently, for CALIPSO data, most scientific visualizations show the orbit track of CALIPSO on the overhead view map along side the LiDAR profile data. The objective of this project is to visualize both the orbital track on the flat maps and the LiDar profile data together. This can be done by using the Cesium Javascript Library, that uses HTML5 and WebGL to render 3D Globes and maps.
