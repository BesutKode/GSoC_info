As a truly immersive display setup, Liquid Galaxy provides a user with a unique experience in which focus and context are both available at the same instant of time. Such immersion becomes more and more relevant for applications involving visualization of huge environments such as Stellarium. In this project, I propose to implement the support for Liquid Galaxy on Stellarium and shall provide basic navigation controls based on hand and face tracking using Microsoft Kinect.
