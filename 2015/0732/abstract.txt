App Inventor is the one of the most easiest path from idea to product. Almost everything great and big out there on the internet has one key feature called growth or scalability. Component Development Kit (CDK) for App Inventor just does that. CDK gives App Inventor extendability allowing developers to create custom components not already available in  App Inventor. These  components can be imported to any App Inventor project hence boosting the development of similar projects.
