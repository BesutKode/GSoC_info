Unmoderated mailing lists suffer from the paradox that the more successful they
are, the more difficult they are to use and administer because of the increasing number of users and discussions. Traditional solutions to this problem, such as creating static sublists or providing a Web interface, are not always desirable. To solve this I present dynamic sublists, an approach to scaling online communities that increases communication opportunities without overwhelming users or administrators.
