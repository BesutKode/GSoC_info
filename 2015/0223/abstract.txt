I would like to work on Testing Infrastructure (FreeBSD cluster). My goal is complete infrastructure for automatization installs and tests of FreeBSD or Linux. The base of this project will be iPXE and iPXE scripts as a backend to control nodes. For frontend I propose a small python webapplication. The applications of this project are non-limited (testing kernels, network test, parallel packages building).
