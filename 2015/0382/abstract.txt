Ensemble learning is a popular and useful machine learning technique. However there are only limited R packages focusing on this task. I will implement several SVM-based ensemble learners in the R package mlr. The implementation will focus both on the accuracy and efficiency. The efficiency will be boosted by C++ based codes. There will be improvements in ensemble selection algorithms for stacked learners.
