I believe Mono and its capabilities are providing a great value to Software Developers and have helped define a path for Open Source projects and their communities. It is with this in mind that I am interested in helping the Mono Project team by contributing to incorporating the newly Open Sourced components of the Microsoft .Net Framework. By integrating components of the .Net Framework, Monoâ€™s Code Base would inherit its value, code quality, and build additional functionality.
