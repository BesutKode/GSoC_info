Pioneer is the chosen game to receive support with the use of Lightmelody,it was chosen because it is an old open source game still in development. Its online multiplayer doesnÂ´t include any social functionality that could easily be included with XMPP.

It is built in C, and it implements the Glib bundle with Gio. making it an excelent choise for for the project due to the fact that Lightmelody is a Gio library, making  it easy to replace or port over the network code.
