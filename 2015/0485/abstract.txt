The R package mlr is a mighty tool for executing various machine learning tasks. Due to its unified interface when dealing with different learners, users may employ them without learning the syntax for each one of them. By implementing a task-dependent default for the learners' parameters, mlr will benefit w.r.t. its user-friendliness and the model fit of the learners will improve. The parameter setup will also be integrated in further methods, e.g. allowing tuning methods to use their defaults.
