Currently pgmpy supports algorithms like Variable Elimination and Belief Propagation for exact inference. In large graphs, exact inference becomes computationally intractable. Thus, there's a need for approximate algorithms which answer the inference query with a lower time complexity. In this project I will implement the two most popular sampling algorithms for inference which fall under the general class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods: Gibbs Sampling and Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm etc.
