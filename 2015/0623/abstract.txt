The objective of Word Sense Disambiguation is to determine which sense of a word is meant in a particular context. Apache OpenNLP currently lacks a WSD module, therefore, the purpose of this project is to design and build a WSD module that implement the algorithms of common supervised techniques. The implemented techniques could serve as examples for any future contributor that would like to add other approaches.
