Mobile, Internet of Things, Bring Your Own Device in general introduces a bigger demand for Public Key Infrastructure. This idea is to enhance Keycloak with Certificate Authority to issue certificates for users, applications and devices. An interesting extension point to the project will be to add support for automatic certificate management by Automated Certificate Management Environment specification (ACME). If feasible this will also delegate to Let's Encrypt for public domains.
