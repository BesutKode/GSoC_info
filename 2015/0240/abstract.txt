Right now pgmpy doesn’t have the feature to add state names for random variables. Therefore user’s have to work with some randomly assigned state indexes for the states of the random variables. In the case of huge networks it really get difficult to keep a trace of the indexes of the states. So, this project would focus on implementing a framework that would enable users to work entirely with state names.
