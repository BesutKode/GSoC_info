NIX project is implemented in C++ and scientists/developers might face the limitation of benefiting from these efficient scientific data-set processing modules due to difference in their computational environment. This project focuses on developing Java bindings for NIX by interfacing the C++ library using SWIG and hence bridging the gap between NIX modules and Java users as Java is popularly in scientific computing.
