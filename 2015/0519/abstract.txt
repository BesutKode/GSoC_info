In this project, implementation of a new tracking algorithm is proposed to provide a fast and robust tracking algorithm in the OpenCV library. The proposed implementation is based on  Kernelized Correlation Filter (KCF) which is claimed to have reliable result (better than TLD) with very fast computation time (100fps on MATLAB implementation). Thus, this contribution is very useful for OpenCV where the users are demanding a robust method which is able to work in real-time for their applications.
