Ganeti is a cluster management software using virtualization technologies such as Xen or KVM and other open source software. Ganeti considers all nodes in a single node group as equal. However, this is not true in some setups. This project aims to improve location awareness of Ganeti. This will be done by introducing common-failure and migration tags. Another related approach is to allow user explicitly specify the desired instance location that can also be implemented using a tags mechanism.
