The project aims to create a one-stop solution for the management of inventory in a laboratory, from the purchase and supply of inventory to its storage, analysis, stock control and defect management. In addition, the module will aid the laboratory users by evaluating the current stock and expenses. Based on this data predictions will be made on the depletion time of stocks and their future demand. The audit trails for each data change are also recorded in accordance with GLP and FDA Guidelines.
