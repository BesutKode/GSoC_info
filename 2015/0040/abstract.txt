Tools to set-up thematic maps showing connections or dependencies between different spatial features (e.g., good imports/exports of the World's countries, flight connections between airports, or chat contacts between Internet users) are hard to find. Thus, this project addresses the realization of an application that allows to set up connection maps based on X3D (resp. X3DOM for the Web) in 3D space based on 52Â°North Triturus.
