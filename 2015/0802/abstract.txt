ScribeUI is a cloud-based and open-source Mapfile editing utility for MapServer. Its goal is to simplify the creation and edition of Mapserver maps with a custom syntax and a visual interface. Its use of variables and layer ranges allow the users to make maps more efficiently than by writing regular Mapfiles by hand.

My objectives for this summer are to improve the error detection of ScribeUI, add the ability on import and export workspaces and add class generation from a set of data.
