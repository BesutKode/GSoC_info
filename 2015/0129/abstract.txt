The project is to build an online Verilog IDE based on YosysJS. Verilog IDE means here the ability to code in Verilog, synthesize the code into a digital schematic and evaluate the schematic. First step is to produce an interactive schematic viewer. Second step is to give the ability to the user to evaluate easily his schematic. Last step is to create an web application based on the previous work. The user will be able to save Verilog Codes and to get access to saved codes.
