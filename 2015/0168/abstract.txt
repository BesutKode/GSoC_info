The aim of the project is to improve VisPy, a rendering and plotting library for Python. 
This can be divided into three broad sub-tasks
* Port interesting examples from other graphics libraries like Glumpy to VisPy
* Bring high-level plotting constructs to VisPy.
* Improve performance by implementing batching (called collections)
