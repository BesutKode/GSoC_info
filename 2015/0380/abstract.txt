Create a graph backing store for OpenCog using Neo4j graph database. The GraphBackingStore API will extend the current BackingStore C++ API. It can take special queries that map naturally into Cypher queries and simple manipulations of Neo4j graph traversals. The Neo4j node-relationship structures and custom indices will be optimized for AtomSpace usage and performance. neo4c C/C++ library will be improved to allow OpenCog C/C++ code to execute Neo4j Cypher queries over REST.
