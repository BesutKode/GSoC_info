The goal of this project is to come up with an add-in for MonoDevelop that generates a class diagram for a solution with a good user experience. It would make use of the language service of Mono Develop to fetch the details of the code base such as classes, hierarchy, interfaces, methods and display them in the form of a Class diagram in a neat user interface allowing various operations on it.
