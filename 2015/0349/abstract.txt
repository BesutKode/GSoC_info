This project aim to make the OpenBSD USB userland more consistent, simpler to
use and deliver a unified tool to view attached usb device, usbdump(8).

Currently, OpenBSD USB userland interface are opaque system call. We don't know
what happen without reading the code, especially if they generate I/O. This
cause problem with library like libusb which shouldn't cause I/O. Caching
static data should fix this problem and suppress the need of system call for
reading static data.
