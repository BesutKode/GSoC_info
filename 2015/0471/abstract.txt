Clouds and cloud shadows often obscure parts of images acquired by satellites or other sensors. However, useful image data could be extracted from other non-cloudy images of the same geographical location that can be used to fill these obscure parts. When combined together with the right algorithms, these images can offer a cloud-free view of that area. Adding this functionality to GeoTrellis would enable users to run this process over any amount of imagery, in a scalable way.
