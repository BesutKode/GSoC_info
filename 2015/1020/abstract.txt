Current implementation of Gaussian mixture model (GMM), variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture model (VBGMM) and Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM) in scikit-learn have many problems. They suffer from interface incompatibility, incorrect model training and incompleteness of testing. In this project, I propose to clean up APIs of GMM, re-implement the updating functions of VBGMM and DPGMM based on well-acknowledged literature, and pass various test cases.
