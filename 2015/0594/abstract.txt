This project is a refactoring project for Rails, it consists of some refactoring work like refactoring ActiveSupport::Parameters to not depend on Ruby's standard Hash also ActionView::OutputBuffer needs to not depend on Ruby's standard String (through ActiveSupport::SafeBuffer. ActionView helpers can provide a new API using the new Ruby 2 first class support for keyword arguments, building on the ground work of Kirill on merged PR#18323. Also ActionView needs to be decoupled from ActionPack.
