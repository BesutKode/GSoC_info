The project is based on the new Raspberry Pi 2. This version provides a significant performance boost for the mini-computer with the introduction of a quadcore processor in its SOC. The main aim is to have an SMP environment running for this version of Pi. For this, the BSP has to be extended to bring up the other three cores. Once enabled, SMP configurations would be tested. The project addresses a cache performance issue with current board support by achieving the correct configurations.
