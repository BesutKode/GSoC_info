The way temporary tables are opened  in MariaDB does not allow them to be used more than once in the same query like with ordinary tables. That is to say we cannot perform for example a join operation on a temporary table and itself. This project will break this limitation on temporary tables by providing an efficient way of opening temporary tables such that they can be reused in the same query just like ordinary tables.
