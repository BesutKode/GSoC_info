Nuancier is a Python Flask voting application for the supplementary wallpapers included in Fedora releases. My project aims to solve the design constraint that doesn't let users with multi monitor setup to take advantage of these high resolution wallpapers such that they can set different parts of wallpaper on different monitors without breaking its continuity. Upload feature will also be enhanced to support already split images of a wallpaper.
