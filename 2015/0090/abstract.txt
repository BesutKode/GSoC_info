This projects implements a common class SEPLightCurve and its three subclass (ERNE/ACE/STEREO-LightCurve) for the three type of instruments that provide SEP data. It reads in SEP data as a lightcurve object and implements basic analytical,  visualization and comparison methods like Visualisation as time series, as energy spectrum, of intensity ratios of different particle species, comparing the SEP observations with other light-curve type data.  It  adds capability for solar event recognition.
