The current 802.15.4 MAC implementation in ns-3, lacks sleep features. The radio is assumed to be always active, which is not true for nodes deployed in the field which usually employ some sort of sleep/wake mechanism in order to conserve energy. The goal of this project is to develop a realistic MAC model and link it with the energy model in order to simulate realistic scenarios where a nodeâ€™s energy can get depleted resulting in changes in the network topology.
