There are two parts to this project: the first is to implement a variation of the LLL-algorithm, the core algorithm of the library, to run on the Gram matrix of the basis rather than on the explicit basis. The other part is to allow for the retrieval of the transformation matrix (that is, if the original basis is B and the LLL-reduced basis is C, we want U s.t. C = B.U). This will be done in two ways: explicitely solving U = B^-1 * C and computing U during the execution of the LLL-algorithm.
