Apache Phoenix is a high performance relational database layer on top of HBase. Tracing had been introduced to Apache Phoenix. My project is to take tracing to the next level and provide visualization to the tracing information. This project will select the best open source charting and visualizing libraries available and integrate with Phoenix to add the required functionality to the system.
