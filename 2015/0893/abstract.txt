CSymPy currently lacks a polynomial module which is very essential in achieving CSymPy's goal of being the fastest CAS ever. Having a polynomial module is a core concern and implementing a fast module also help in achieving a fast series module and other modules. Once implemented, CSymPy will be more capable as a fast optional SymPy core which I think is good to ship before 1.0 at the same time being a powerful CAS on it's own.
