The OpenWorm project is an attempt to build the first digital life form using open source code. The fidelity of OpenWorm to its biological counterpart, C. elegans, depends on the realism of its constituent parts, such as computationally-modelled cells. The internal dynamics of these cells are largely controlled by ion channels, so a biophysically-informed ion channel model will, in-turn, support a realistic model of the entire organism.
