I propose a project to improve Wget's security by adding support for some of the most widely used and regarded security mechanisms. If this proposal gets accepted, by the end of the project, Wget will be able to handle the HSTS extension to HTTP, and to interact with an FTP server via SSL/TLS. This is a copy-paste of the original document, which is hosted at Google Drive, and can be found in the additional info URL.
