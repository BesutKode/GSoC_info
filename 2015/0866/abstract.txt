Plasma is using kde-look to provide their users a distribution system of custom content, let them be backgrounds, themes, apps etc. This service is beginning to feel the age, is unmantained and isn't directly controlled by KDE because the server-side code that runs the service isn't owned by KDE. This project aims to replace kde-look with an in-house fully open implementation of the software stack used to run the content delivery infrastructure. I will update Gluon Player aswell.
