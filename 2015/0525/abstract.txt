MiniDNS is a DNS client library, which allows Android Apps and Java programs to resolve DNS resource records (RR). Adding support for DNSSEC would be the logical next step to improve the security of the software using MiniDNS. Since MiniDNS runs also on JavaSE runtimes, i.e. it is not an Anroid exclusive library, all applications using it would also become DNSSEC enabled. Once MiniDNS is able to perform DNSSEC, it should be used in smack-resolver-minidns for DNS resolution.
