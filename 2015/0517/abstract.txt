The goal of the project is to create a toolchain to make it easy for people to contribute new, short-form content articles. This proposed toolchain will allow people to contribute article in a very easy way, then after getting it reviewed and tagged, push it into centos git repository as well as upstream repositories which are tagged. The toolchain at each step will convert the document into appropriate format, apply styles according to guidelines and update the appropriate documentation site.
