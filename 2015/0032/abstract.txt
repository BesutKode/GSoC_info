I would like to work fixing bugs as they are reported.  I am interested in refactoring existing code as needed.  I would also like to work on d33tah's suggestion for implementing scanning of Tor hidden services "out-of-the-box" with nmap. Most of this work would be done in the C code in nmap, nbase, ncat, nmap-update, and nping. If needed I can also work on bugs in python portions of the project like zenmap or ndiff.
