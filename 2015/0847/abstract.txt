The aim is to build a framework for easy communication between the ARM and PRUSS. Currently these features are provided by libprussdrv and linux kernelâ€™s remoteproc infrastructure. However both have their limitation and require developers to hack kernel drivers to optimize them for their application. This project would develop a lightweight, robust easy-to-use, yet powerful communication framework for ARM-PRU, which would make life for beaglebone users a lot easier.
