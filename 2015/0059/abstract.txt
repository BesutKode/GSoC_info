The Project aims at improving the current Equation solvers in SymPy. The Current solve is a huge mess, It needs to be broken into various sub-hints, to make the code more robust, modular, and approachable for developers, moving in lines of the new API, as developed in solveset. Currently the new API is implemented for univariate Equations only, we need to incorporate it for linear systems, multivariate equations & transcendental by rewriting the solvers for these in the new solveset Module.
