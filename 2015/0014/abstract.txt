I would like the chance to work on the restructuring of the Tardis plasma module. I have used Tardis in the past for my own research, and I have added new physics to the plasma module for my own purposes. I am therefore quite familiar with how Tardis works and with the plasma module in particular. If I were given the chance to work on the new plasma module framework, I would be able to add my own alterations, which have proved very successful, into the distributed version of Tardis.
