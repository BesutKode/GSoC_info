The GSoC 2015 SciRuby Linear Mixed Model project suits my skills and interests nearly perfectly. I am a third year Mathematics PhD student at Tulane University working on statistics and machine learning. I have substantial experience with mixed models. I have worked with basic linear mixed effects models, mixed effect smoothing spline methods, and incorporation of linear mixed effects into sparse linear regression models. My programming languages of choice are R, C++ and, more recently, Ruby.
