The aim of the project is to make a plugin for gedit which can do static analysis on code and make these visible to the user (and if possible, auto-correct). coala, the code-analysis application provides a framework for static analysis along with modularized analyzers called bears. In the project, coala will be extended to support dbus outputs and gedit-code-assistance will be configured to allow coala as an additional backend.
