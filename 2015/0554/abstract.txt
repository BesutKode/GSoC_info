This project is to implement an online sandbox for Android apps. A basic scenario is: a user upload an app to our website, we run dynamic analysis of this app on server and dump the report to the user. Additional features include: searching or browsing analysed apps, uploading customised monkeyrunner scripts, etc. This project contains three parts of work including frontend UI design, backend logic design, and automatic testing support for Droidbox.
