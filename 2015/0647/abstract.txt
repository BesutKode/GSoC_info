My name is Nick Confrey, and Processing sparked my love of programming. I am excited to return to where I began, see how far I've come, and help an amazing organization. My idea extends the Processing Network library. I believe that linking computers together over the network and exchanging text, images or sound is a tremendously exciting possibility for new coders, but also very daunting. I aim to extend this excitement to everyone through an easily accessible Network library.
