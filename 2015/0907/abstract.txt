Sketch is a browser-based IDE for p5.js. Developed in conjunction with p5's new desktop platform, Sketch begins with the set of carefully-designed constraints that inform Processing's IDE, and reimagines these for the web. Sketch will have a strong emphasis on sharing, utilizing Git/GitHub as its version control system. Sketch will be a place for the Processing community to share resources, an entry-point for learning web development, and a vibrant hub spotlighting the best in creative code.
