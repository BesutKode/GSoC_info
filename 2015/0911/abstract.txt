With introduction of System.Numerics.Vectors, Microsoft .NET Framework provided a great way of improving the performance of heavy computations by using SIMD extensions. My project involves implementing the same library for Mono to give it the same performance boost! Apart from that, I want to extend Mono JIT compiler so while using the library it would take full advantage of the SSE extension.
