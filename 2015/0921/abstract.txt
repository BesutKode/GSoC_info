The legacy user interface for OpenMRS 1.9 is chiefly comprised of administrative functions and the patient dashboard. Apparently, a new and more contemporary UI was introduced via a UI framework and the legacy UI was kept around for administrative functions. To retire the Legacy UI as planned, it is required to move the implementations and modules that still rely on it in order to maintain backwards compatibility.
