As I have experience contributing to TEAMMATES as well as web app development, I would like to contribute to TEAMMATES by optimizing its sister issue tracker HubTurbo's performance, which allows managing TEAMMATES issues is easier for the dev team and project admin. My design for the optimization involves using an alternative method to store issue data, as well as two different ways in which the issue tracker sync mechanism can be improved.
