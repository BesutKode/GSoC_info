I understand that XBoard needs a GTK developer from their webpage. And it is still using Gtk2 not the updated version of Gtk(3).  And also it seems that XBoard GTK demands for some more accessibility features. What i have noticed is that there is no navigation of pieces using arrow keys and also it does not help a visually challenged person to know current position of pieces in the board. it is also noted that ORCA(Screen Reader) does not right away announce the movement played by the opponent.
