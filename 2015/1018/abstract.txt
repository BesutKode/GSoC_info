This project is to generate thumbnails for student programs and display them when browsing projects. As stated on the ideas page, this task can be performed in either the server side or the browser side. Both these approaches have their challenges, as they might not render the output faithfully to what the student sees when actually running the program. My approach is to combine these two ways to make them complement each other so as to overcome the drawbacks.
