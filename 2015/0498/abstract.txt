When developing software, it's necessary to have a lot data about what you're creating. It's necessary to have information about the performance of the system. We need to know whether the system or platform is getting faster or slower. This information is vital to software development because catching bugs or issues later in development gets more and more expensive. This is where benchmarking comes into play. Benchmarking can help to catch errors early.
