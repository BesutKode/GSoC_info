This project aims at developing a generic top level monitoring/alarming interface for the ERAS Habitat module to manage all relevant information. It will also have a sub-GUI for the health monitor where different data from V-ERAS will be shown on a preferential basis and the user will be able to modify the GUI as per the need. It will also aim to enable the GUI to properly interact with the Tango server and leverage the functionality of the existing Tango Alarm Systems.
