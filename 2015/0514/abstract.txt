The main goal of the project is to provide robotics research environment with succinct report of manipulation activities performed by a robot. To this end, an automated Report Card generation tool will be developed as an extension of widely used CRAM system.
Such Report Card will consist of basic robot performance measures that are easy to view, read and interpret, therefore, time-consuming raw data analysis that needed additional statistical knowledge wonâ€™t be necessary.
