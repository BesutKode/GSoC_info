This is a proposal for the improvement and expansion of the work done during the last two GSoC editions in scene text detection and recognition. The proposed tasks for this year GsoC include the implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks for Scene Text Recognition, and efficient Text-likeliness Pre-filters. Additionally it includes optional proposals for two algorithmic improvements of the current pipeline, and for the implementation of evaluation code for standard datasets (ICDAR RRC).
