FLINT implements matrix multiplication using integer arithmetic. The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) define a set of fundamental operations on vectors and matrices which can be used to create optimized higher-level linear algebra functionality. The goal of this project is to allow FLINT to use an external floating-point BLAS library to multiply matrices over finite fields, integers and rationals [High Performance GEMM-based Level 3 BLAS : Kagstrom, Ling and Loan]
