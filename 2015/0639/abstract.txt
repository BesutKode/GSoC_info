This project aims to develop a qemu target for arm64 architecture. Currently, In order to work on coreboot for aarch64, one usually needs a arm64 board. To reduce this barrier, we aim to bring in a arm64 qemu port. Presently, arm64 isnâ€™t a supported architecture in emulation, mainly due to the fact that the port we have runs in 32-bit for bootblock and romstage stages. Having a qemu target might be helpful for many projects which aim to arm64 work.
