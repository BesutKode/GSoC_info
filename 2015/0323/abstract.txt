GNUstep is a free software implementation of the Cocoa (Appleâ€™s native object-oriented API). One of the libraries in its implementation is Core Animation. In its current state, it could be used only for games and demos; it is fairly incomplete. Some of the problems include low performance, bugs etc. Primary goal of this project is to develop it to be usable in practice: in applications and on mobile devices.
