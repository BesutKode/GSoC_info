Kubernetes is an open source system for managing containerized applications. A user can use the command line tool kubectl to deploy, maintain, and scale his applications. The purpose of this proposal is to improve user's navigation experience on kubectl through helpful API type/operation descriptions on both CLI and Swagger (Issues: #3060, #5331, #3059 and #2971) and also through implementing various other issues from the CLI roadmap.
