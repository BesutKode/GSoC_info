The project aims to enhance the features of the soy.scenes.Landscape module. The idea is to add a plugin system that can support different landscape elements like vegetation and weather (shrubs, trees, winds, lightning, rain, snow) which would allow for easier customization of the scene. Bigger scenes will also be achievable through a tiling system that will permit multiple landscapes to be placed in a grid pattern.
