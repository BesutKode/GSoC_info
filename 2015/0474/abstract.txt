In this project, I intend to work on the fields section of pysoy core and improve upon it. My project basically involves working with the two main classes of fields, which are Wind and Bouyancy. Moreover to implement these classes I will have to work on Bodies as well. The goals of my project will be, first to get the current field working, adding functionality to the soy.bodies, improving and implementing the new wind class and finally working on bouyancy class.
