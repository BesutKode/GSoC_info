Vispy is a high performance 2D/3D visualization library which uses the GPU intensively through OpenGL. This Google Summer of code project proposes to add an API to Vispy to visualize static and dynamic (boolean, linear and Bayesian) networks. Additionally, I would like to add support for calculating projections onto a given 2D or 3D subspace on the GPU, which helps when you want to visualize higher dimensional data.
