The goal of this project is to build a dynamic malware analysis system on ART, which allows users to monitor the execution of potentially malicious apps. This project guarantee two points: low performance overhead and easily maintainability.My proposal contains two main ideas. One is to use inline functions hook with trampolines to intercept function calls. The other one is build a .so from AOSP code that will be injected inside target application  memory  to achieve runtime instrumentation.
