I work as part of my thesis on the generation of data collection applications for tuberculosis surveillance with Imogene. In fact, the Imogene studio is using openArchitectureWare and the Xpand language to generate the set of application giving a model. But openArchitectureWare does not look to be maintained. The goal of the project is to migrate from openArchitectureWare technologies to Acceleo which is newer, provide more functionalities and is better documented.
