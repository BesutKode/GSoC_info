Currently Archer supports table editing for mesh data in BoTs. Editing is interactive, in that when a particular shell of a model is highlighted in the tree panel, users can update its vertex information via a table. Similar interactive editing is proposed here to provide interactive editing of the Non-Manifold Geometry data-structures (NMG) [1] in BRL-CAD. In addition to editing, validation on the models will be performed and the results displayed for the user in Archerâ€™s interface.
