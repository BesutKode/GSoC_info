Science Gateways federate resources from multiple organizations. Most gateways solve the problem of scheduling across multiple organizations in an ad hoc, per-gateway fashion. HPC environments statically partition their resources to avoid interference between multiple applications. Static partitioning is known to lead to low utilization. This project will evaluate and provide recommendations for how Apache Mesos can be used with Apache Airavata for efficient scheduling of gateway jobs.
