The requirement is to develop a Command Line Tool to interact with WSO2 AppFactory, so that a user can perform functionalities on AppFactory platform via the CLI tool similar to using the Web based GUI interface. I am planning to use 'GO' as the scripting language to build the CLI Tool. The deliverable for the project is a command line tool which provides above mentioned capabilities and which is compatible with linux, windows and mac operating systems.
