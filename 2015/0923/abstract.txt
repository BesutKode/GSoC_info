Distributed systems that use the RPC model could benefit from having typing data included in invocations. This would make it possible to quickly find deployment problems related to mismatching interfaces between different nodes. Most current RPC protocols do not include typing data in invocations or, if they do, this information is present in inefficient representations. The goal of this project is to design and develop a typed binary serialization format and an RPC protocol using this format.
