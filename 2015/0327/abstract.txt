This is a project to implement the new index helper proposed and prototyped by Andr√© Arko. This index will allow Bundler to do exactly what it does today but using less network and server resources. In the end we will have all necessary implementation done and a test version. The objective of this project is make rubists happier by using a faster bundler, and bundler developer hapier by not having to lose their sleep.
