Lil' Debi provides the power of Debian on the Android Phone, it allows a user to use services of Debian. The key missing part of the project is the setting up the things for user, making Lil Debi for the non techie users, profile creation will resolve this issue. There are other features which need to be implemented like support for latest android e.g Lollipop, file manager support, support for Ubuntu, and I am very interested in looking for Lil Debis support for x86 processor architecture, etc.
