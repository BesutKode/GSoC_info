Numerical accuracy is essential in verifying the model behavior. This proposal involves using systems with known solutions with TVB's numerical methods to determine how accurate the methods are. The testing results contains two parts. One is improving the numerical method itself to evaluate the accuracy, thus get an overview idea between the trade off of computation and accuracy. The other is to compare the known solution with other numerical software (e.g., XPPAUT) to evaluate the accuracy.
