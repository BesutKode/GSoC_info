Structured Light Systems (SLS), formed by the combination of a projector with a camera, are simple and effective tools to acquire 3D models. But such a high accuracy is only possible if camera and projector are both properly calibrated, so it's essential to implement inside the OpenCV library an appropriate calibration procedure in order to easily retrieve the valuable 3D information that SLS can supply.
