Autosuggestions are awesome. Looking into hub/etc, completion scripts for bash and zsh already exist, but those scripts are manually written and need to be updated every time a new command/option is added to Hub. What is lacking is a way to list and define all commands and their respective options in a common file and to generate/update completion scripts based upon those definitions.
