PyDSTool is a Python library for simulating and exploring the activity of dynamical systems. We present a new graphical user interface and interactive toolkit aimed at allowing neuroscientists to develop data-driven models of brain activity. The project includes a new UI, coherent redesign of supporting classes, and a suite of relevant neural dynamical systems test cases. We also include documentation and tutorials for new users of PyDSTool.
