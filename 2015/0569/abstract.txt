This project aims to create a terrain generator and adding more features to soy.scenes.Landscape which is just a heightmap for now. Other features include on the fly terrain data generation, texture mapping and vegetation. The terrain engine will focus on developing games like starcraft and 3D farm games where the perspective is from above and not like FPS games. Thus, the final optimization techniques will be applied accordingly.
