ImageJ is a public domain Java image processing program designed with an open architecture that provides extensibility via Java plugins. The aim of this project is to develop an ImageJ plugin which can be used to download/upload datasets from/to iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System), an  open source data management software used by the research community in order to take control of their data, regardless of where and on what device the data is stored.
