Turtle Blocks 3D is an extension of the turtle blocks activity written in JavaScript to 3D and is a port to JavaScript of turtle blocks 3D version written in python with added features.This project would add basic 3D functions to turtle blocks (e.g. pitch, roll, yaw), camera handling, 3D lighting, texture mapping, blender export, and lot of examples. A 3D implementation in JavaScript would take advantage of libraries like texture mapping and 3D lighting as well as full compatibility with OpenGL.
