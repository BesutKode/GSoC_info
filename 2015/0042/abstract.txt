The aim of this project is to make Crowdmap foolproof to network errors resulting from poor connections. This involves reducing optimizing features to reduce bandwidth usage, making use of client side storage like IndexedDB & caches to store the data during network errors and sync them into the central database when network is available. Hubspot's Offline will be used to read the network state and perform the actions based on this. Much lighter & network error resistant Crowdmap is the target.
