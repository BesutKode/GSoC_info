Scikit-Image depends on scipy.ndimage for various operations (filters for example). scipy.ndimage has several advantages: it works for ndarrays and the performance is really good; however, it is written using the Python C API which makes the code hard to read and hence to maintain. Rewriting the module in Cython would improve its maintainability. A possible challenge is to keep the good performances of the current implementation.
