Through this project, I hope to introduce new design templates and an elegant set of user interfaces to the Photo Language Translation app. The project aims to add more features such as organization-level login, team management, admin dashboard, RESTful API and HTML5 offline capabilities. Adding users activity records, article revisioning and discussions among the team members are the enhancement of the photo sections. I hope these implementations will enhance and improve the user experience.
