The standard subtitle format used in MP4 containers is 3GPP timed text. It is the only subtitle format supported in Apple's media players on OS X and iOS. As such it is important for FFmpeg to support the format as fully as possible. Currently, it supports only a limited subset of the format. For this project, the goal would be to implement complete support for these features and have the implementation fully reviewed and merged into FFmpeg.
