My proposal is to migrate Buildbotâ€™s web UI to Angular Material. I will work together with the mentors to give Buildbot another suite of UI based on Material Design and  Angular Material will be used to achieve the desired appearance. The main reason to propose this idea is that bootstrap has some shortcomings compared with Angular Material especially when it comes to cooperating with AngularJS. This migration will give Buildbot a new look and I believe Buildbot will benefit a lot from this.
