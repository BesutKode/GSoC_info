I aim to improve performance of matrixStats package to provide users with faster and more memory-conservative functions. The proposed work includes expanding existing matrixStats function to support optional arguments for subsetted computations, implementing support for parallel processing and tuning parallel setup arguments in order to make matrixStats smarter on parallel processing. I will also write sufficient tests, benchmark reports and relevant documents.
