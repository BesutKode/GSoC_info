The goal of this project is to design and implement the solution for securing AIRAVATA API. Particularly, this includes authenticating and authorizing end users in to AIRAVATA API. One of the challenges in this project is to design a unified solution which can be easily adapted to set of identified use cases that are based on different identity management scenarios. The proposed solution addresses all such use cases and involves open identity management standards.
