WSO2 ESB mediate JMS message communication through JMS Transport and JMS Inbound endpoint. Due to itsâ€™ well maintained  code base and comprehensive documentation, JMS communication has been one of the highly used feature in WSO2 ESB.  But with only JMS 1.1 support JMS transport and inbound endpoint has become outdated and non-scalable.Therefor it would be really beneficial for the ESB users, to have JMS 2.0 support soon on WSO2 ESB.
