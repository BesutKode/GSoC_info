The goal of the project is to extend the Beacon of Beacons (BoB) with a JavaScript (preferably AngularJS) console. The web console will allow the administrators to configure beacons and monitor usage of BoB.  From technological standpoint, the project is client-side JavaScript development with a gamut of visualization-related work and will include contributions to the BoB frontend itself, which will publicly expose some of the generated statistics.
