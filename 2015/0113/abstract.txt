Test another optimization algorithm in the population modeling part of MOSES, more specifically, use the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for it, and then conduct tests with MOSES standard problems, compared with the current best algorithm for some problems (Hill Climbing + Crossover), documenting these resulting in the process. Inside Content there's an explanation why I chose PSO and some personal information.
