In this proposal, I am going to describe an implementation of how a docker image can be run in sandbox environment. Docker is a container based virtualization technology which has gained significant popularity past 2 years. Docker has huge repository of ready-made templates which leverage users to install and use application containers easily. By running docker images in virt-sandbox environment will let anyone to access huge number of already-built containers without delving into configuration.
