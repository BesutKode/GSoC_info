This document proposes a new command-line program and associated library that would identify interface differences between two versions of a cabal package. In this context, the term “interface” refers to any part of the cabal package that constitutes its public API, including every module export. Users will be able to view summaries of package changes in a variety of formats, and a long-term goal of this proposal is to integrate this functionality into Hackage.
