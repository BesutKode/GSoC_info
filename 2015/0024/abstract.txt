Internet of Things(IoT) is expected to offer advanced connectivity of devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machine-to-machine communications (M2M) and covers a variety of protocols, domains, and applications. We aim at making Tools and create a binding between SleekXMPP and various Devices like Netatmo,intel edisonetc. which can be controlled by means of Client Applications. Also to check compatibility between Devices, i.e. if they can exchange Data between each other.
