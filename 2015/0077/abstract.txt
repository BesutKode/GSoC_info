Visualizations is the best way to understand information from documents. Traditional interaction techniques are used to do so. New means of interaction are available. Therefore, I propose to take advantage of Kivy multi-touch support to develop an API that will handle the generation and interaction of matplotlib widgets. In addition I propose an additional class to handle strokes over a canvas. This will allow developers to instantiate graphs and interact directly with gestures over them.
