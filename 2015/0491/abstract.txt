In the given proposal, I have listed ideas for the Photo Language Translation project that are thought out keeping in mind the requirements of the Peace Corps volunteers. These features will enhance the usability of the application and provide  much better support to develop the native languages and train the volunteers in a particular language. I have also planned a weekly timeline for the three months of development with milestones and provisions for coding, testing, and documentation.
