VPM-B is a scheduling algorithm for advanced divers, who seek more aggressive and yet safe ascending plans. My project will focus on this algorithms better understanding, writing it's clear description that can be used for other programmers and finally, implementing it as part of the Subsurface scheduling architecture. As a side effect, I will refactor Subsurface planner code, so it allows adding more scheduling algorithms in the future.
