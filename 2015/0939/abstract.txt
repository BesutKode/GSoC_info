The idea is to show that a game of a considerable size (30,000-50,000 lines of C/C++ code) could be written using reactive programming language Céu in a few months.

The most possible game candidate is Supertux yet.

Game would be written on Céu from scratch. There also would be a report about Céu game development experience and the final game would be compared with the original.

I've already worked with SDL2 using C/C++ and built the development environment on my Windows machine.
