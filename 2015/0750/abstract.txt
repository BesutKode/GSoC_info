Descartes is an actively developed path planning library for industrial processes, including welding, machining, and painting. The first task is to develop a Descartes - MoveIt adapter which would allow the use of a few existing tools. The second phase includes improving upon the ROS Message API by creating new or leverage existing ROS APIs in order to exploit the full power of Descartes functionality, allowing higher level GUIs and other ROS processes access to Descartes planning capabilities.
