Geometry conversion is a very important aspect for every CAD software as it is the basis for CAD data exchange between various CAD softwares. BRL-CAD has dozens of importers and exporters but this does not include support for X3D file import. This project seeks to implement an X3D importer for BRL-CAD and would rely on using the FreeWRL's X3D parsing library for this task. FreeWRL is an open source compliant VRML/X3D browser which is multi-threaded, written in C, and uses OpenGL for rendering.
