A Word Grammar parser, when complete, will take each word of a sentence and draw syntactic connections between the previous ones based not only on syntactic rules, but also on other semantic, morphological, phonological and graphological information. The parser will use information from the AtomSpace, OpenCog's artificial general intelligence knowledge base. Word Grammar parsing will much more closely resemble how humans cognize language than Link Grammar parsing, which OpenCog currently uses.
