Risk Analysis is integral part of portfolio management and it is widely used by researchers, students and practitioners alike. We aim to convert the Dowdâ€™s MATLAB code for measurement and visualization of market risk to R and package it for distribution. Considering the wider use of R compared to MATLAB for statistical analysis, thousands of users will benefit from this. Expanding PerformanceAnalytics package with functions from the MATLAB toolbox will benefit a equally large user base.
