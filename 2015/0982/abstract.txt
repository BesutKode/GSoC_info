I wish to develop a mobile and web application for the Tux4ME idea. I have researched over the proposed idea and came out with this proposal.

I have considered this -  "Cambridge brain sciences" developed at Medical research council (MRC), Cambridge, UK. theory as the primary one in studying and choosing the games.

The games are explained in detail in the proposal.  The proposal also contain links to "Design visuals" of mobile app to be developed as a task assigned by the mentor.
