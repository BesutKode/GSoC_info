HAMMER2 is a file system developed by Matthew Dillon for DragonFlyBSD. The main purpose of this new filesystem is to support replication clustering and the core design is heavily influenced by this goal, but the filesystem does support a lot of features which are useful in a single node context.

The goal of this proposal is to port a *subset* of HAMMER2 to OpenBSD and stabilize the port in a single node context. Supporting clustering is out of scope of this project.
