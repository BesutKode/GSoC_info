Search Quick(sQuick) is intended to build an application to enable a user to search and update from a text collection offline. It aims to make substantial use of global index to return better results. Major challenges perceived during the development include multilingual support and designing of optimal algorithm to guarantee quick results. Post GSoC, the project would be maintained and its features updated with time. Looking forward to being a regular developer in the open source community.
