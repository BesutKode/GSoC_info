Apache Phoenix is a high performance relational database layer over HBase for low latency applications. Array data type is supported in Apache Phoenix. But there are only few built in functions currently implemented for manipulation of arrays in Phoenix. But in other relational database systems like Postgresql have a rich set of built in functions to manipulate arrays. The purpose of this project is to implement the missing array built-in functions which are applicable for Phoenix arrays.
