The project aims at improving the phpMyAdmin code base by refactoring existing functions and classes with object-oriented design patterns. The goal of the project is to convert current not well OOPed .lib and .class to be OOPed classes, which will ease future development of phpMyAdmin. This project will bring many benefits to developers like well designed and OOPed classes, and a simple template system for HTML outputs.
