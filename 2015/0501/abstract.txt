Django's URL dispatcher is powerful, but fairly limited in its scope. There is currently no public API that allows users to extend and customize the dispatcher. The internals are intertwined in such a way that it is hard to extend their capabilities. URL namespaces are overly complicated. The aim of this proposal is to provide a simple and extensible API that allows users to customize the URL dispatcher, and to simplify namespaces while maintaining their original purpose.
