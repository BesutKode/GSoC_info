Code completion and refactoring are important features of a modern IDE that greatly help the work of software developers. The focus of this project is to extend JDTâ€™s refactoring functionality with new features, especially with those related to Java 8, and improve the code completion. The code completion will be extended with subwords and postfix completion and at least two new refactoring features will be implemented.
