By building on the existing p5 sound library, I intend to create a more capable and intuitive sound library for all users. Through incorporation of the Tone.js library and a set of predesigned sounds, p5 will be better suited for use in the creation of multimedia web applications. In keeping with the Processing philosophy, all work will be thoroughly documented with well commented examples and tutorials.
