Astronomers heavily rely on uncertainties of measured or model variables in large datasets. My proposed project this summer will be to integrate uncertainty analysis into the astropy Python module. I will integrate the capability for astropy users to track probability density functions in the astropy.units.Quantity class. My proposed addition will provide a harmonious framework for users to track uncertainties throughout their analysis.
