Pywikibot currently lacks support for Flow, a discussion system being implemented as a MediaWiki extension. When Flow is deployed, bots will need to access and update information on Flow pages. Pywikibot is a popular bot framework used with MediaWiki sites, so implementing Flow support is a must. This project involves creating Python classes representing Flow objects, using the MediaWiki API to interface Pywikibot objects with Flow data, and creating extensive test suites to ensure stability.
