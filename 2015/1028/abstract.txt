The aim of this study is SIMD optimizing two independent projects: Philox, a newly proposed CBRNG and VecGeom, a high-performance HEP geometry system, on Intelâ€™s Haswell architecture with AVX2 instruction set. Firstly, internal data structure of Philox will be transformed from AoS to SoA for better auto-vectorization and intrinsics will be used via high-level C++ wrapping library. Secondly, FOG's VCL will be implemented as an alternative backend to Vc to gain more platform independence.
