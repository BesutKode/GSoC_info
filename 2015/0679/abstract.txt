My proposal aims at designing and implementing an add-on system for networkx. Till now, networkx has been a pure python library. But there exists similar software packages written in compiled languages. They achieve greater performance compared to their equivalents in networkx. Along with with the implementation of two non-trivial software packages, my proposal also includes removing the Graph drawing package out of networkx core package and implementing it as an add-on.
