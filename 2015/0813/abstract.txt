Android Wear devices were the most sold wearable gadgets last year. With the introduction of ICE for Android, android devices can communicate with JdeRobot components through ICE interfaces allowing them to be a part of distributed systems. Our project work extends this idea to connect a physical android wear device with JdeRobot and use it for remote control of aerial and ground vehicles.
