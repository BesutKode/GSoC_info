The Chinese street view is a great implement of  "Peruse a rue" . But there are still some  limitations in the Chinese street view. For example, Baidu.co and Tencent,co cover different street view areas, therefore we can merge Baidu's APIs into this project. And Tencent.co has released new street view APIs, which contain more features. we can add these feature and fix the bugs it brings. I would like to add these features into this project.
