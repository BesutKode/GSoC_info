LibreOffice contains a well-structured code-base but there are few unit tests available in it while there is a demand for many, to counter-check the features and sub-routines. By adding more and better unit tests in code-base we can produce more productive features and find regressions as early as possible. This project aims at including better tests on C++, there is also porting of some old Java units to C++ and re-factoring of some tests that do remote control of an existing instance.
