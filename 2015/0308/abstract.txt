My proposal is to develop a plugin to migrate all features of route calculation from the 1.* gvSIG version to the latest one. 
These are the main tasks to do:

     Route management to get the shortest path 
     Optimizing the order of stops on a route 
     Calculation of service areas 
     Location of the nearest event 
     Calculate matrices Origin - Destination 
     Calculation of minimum spanning tree
