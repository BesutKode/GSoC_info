The project idea aims at making the internal libraries used by MBDyn simplified as it have somewhat complicated configuration.

Key-points of this Project Ideas are:

1) Make the libraries installable
2) Abstract libraries in a rational manner, to reduce/eliminate cross-dependencies
3) Replace standard features from broadly available libraries (example Boost)
