CPU architectures often provide a variety of ways to load and save data into memory and registers. Because of this, there are lot of possible addressing sequences for a given code, and finding the optimal one is not a trivial task. However, better addressing can lead to improvements in a program's code size and execution time. The goal of this project is to add a prototype version of such an addressing mode selection pass to GCC.
