This is the Google Summer of Code 2015 Student Proposal for Project Ensemble SVMs in mlr. My primary goals are (1) to deliver an efficient implementation of state-of-the-art ensemble SVM learners in mlr, including Clustered SVM, Divide-and-Conquer SVM, and Mixture of SVM Experts; and (2) to build a systematic and flexible framework of ensemble learning in mlr with two schemes Base-and-Meta-learner (Wolpert, 1992) and Divide-and-Conquer (Guo et al., 2015).
