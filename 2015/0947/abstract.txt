Implementing a new Scene subclass, the Voxel Scene. This would handle 3D terrain data processing, rendering and modifying, as well as integrating with the rest of the engine systems such as physics.

Focusing in on a few parts of this extense area of work: customizable terrain generation, rendering optimization with LoD & heavy culling algorithms and physics integration. At the end of the program render destructible, randomly generated noise terrain that makes sense and has physics.
