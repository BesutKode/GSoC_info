The aim of the project is to equip JuliaQuantum libraries with solvers used in quantum mechanics. 
Goals of the project include:
1.Framework to solve Schrodinger and Quantum Master Equations by Exponential solvers, ODE solvers, Monte Carlo Wave Function Method, Steady State Methods.
2.Parallelizing some of the above tasks using the existing infrastructure for parallel computing features in Julia.
3.In the course of integrating other packages, contribute back to improve their functionality.
