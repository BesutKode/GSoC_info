I find that creating a synergy between PC and phone in a open source and Secure way would really be a benefit to Gnome's User.

Nuntius will not just be intended to be a notification system relay, but a real tight connection, which could be used in many ways. For example, you will be able to read/write sms directly from the pc, or easily share files between them. It comes from a simple base but can be improved widely with any idea we want to add.
