This project aims to develop algorithms to extract out subtle changes in a time-dependent data set and amplify them. The data set can be considered as videos(2D data at each temporal resolution). We also plan to build custom views for Video magnification in VTK. We extract out temporal and spatial frequencies from the given data and amplify specific frequencies according to our use case, which results in minute motion, normally invisible being magnified.
