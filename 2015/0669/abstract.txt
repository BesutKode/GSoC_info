At the moment there isn't any integration plugin between Mapillary service and JOSM, only with ID. As JOSM is one of the most used OSM editors I think that a Mapillary plugin would really be appreciated and useful. The main idea would be to be able to download mapillary pictures and show them in a JOSM layer, so when the users clicks on them the full picture is shown in order to easily identify street level objects.
