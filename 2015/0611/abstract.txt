PyPy is almost feature-compatible with Python 2.7. Where it's lacking is Python 3.x support. PyPy cannot provide compatibility with Python versions newer than 3.2. This is one of the reasons why PyPy's Python 3.x support hasn't seen much adoption among users. Missing adoption also means that there's little interest in contributing to PyPy's 3.x support and it's getting worse because Python 3.x is constantly evolving. A concentrated effort is needed to break this cycle.
