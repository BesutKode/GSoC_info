With the update to of Hackage to Hackage 2.0, a large amount of functionality was added -- most notably, improved search, and better handling of package metadata (such as categories and tags). However, in its current state, it can difficult to discover new or widely-used packages, or to find the best package for a particular task. My proposal is to improve Hackage, both visually and functionally, with the goal of making Haskell packages more easily discoverable.
