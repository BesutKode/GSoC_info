“Opticks is an expandable remote sensing and imagery analysis software platform”. To be usable for remote sensing applications, some images should be enhanced. The Drizzle Algorithm is an image enhancement algorithm able to combine several images of the same phenomenon over time to drastically improve the interpretability of the image. The purpose of this proposal is to implement the Drizzle algorithm into the remote sensing application and imagery analysis software platform Opticks.
