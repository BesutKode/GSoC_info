The purpose of this project is to write a replacement for the current SQL parsing library. In my opinion, it is going to have a huge impact on phpMyAdmin as it improves the user's experience by fixing old bugs and implementing new features, based on users' feedback. For developers, this project will ship a parsing library which will provide high performance and flexibility. I am sure that this library will be a step forward.
