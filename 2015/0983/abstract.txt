Ecology, Biodiversity, Climate Change, invasive species research etc. use Primary Biodiversity occurrence data as basic unit. Even Global Biodiversity Information Facility, largest repository of this data, which serves ~530M records, has gaps and biases in terms of taxonomy, geography and seasonality. We propose to make a R package to wrap the APIs of SNS like Flicke and Picasa and make the data available to users in prevailing international standard formats like Darwin Core and Audubon Core.
