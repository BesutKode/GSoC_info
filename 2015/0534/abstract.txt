Sympy currently lacks a proper structure for handling and manipulating series. All the series related functionality is defined as methods in Expr. I plan to give the series package a concrete structure for future development and improvement. I plan to do the following over the summer.

1 Sequence classes for defining sequences of coefficients

2 Classes to represent series in general

3 Implement Formal Power Series, using the above implemented structure

4 Computing limits of sequences
