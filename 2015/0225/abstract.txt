The development of this project includes setting up a generic automated testing framework in which a Syster web project can be tested.  The generic nature of the framework will allow for other Syster web projects to be tested as well.  In addition, database tests will be implemented to automate queries to fetch data from the database.  Selenium(Junit testing framework) implemented in Java will be used. The end product should be tests which can be reused and automated for regression testing.
