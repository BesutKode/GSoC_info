I propose that it is possible to use an inertial measurement unit consisting of a digital accelerometer and gyro to track the location of a person in three dimensions solely using inexpensive MEMS IMUs. IMUs are notorious for losing accuracy over time, but they are reasonably accurate for short periods of time. This technology could be used to share real-time location information with nearby responders to make search and rescue more effective, and to allow precise rescue of trapped responders.
