This project is divided in two parts: the first is to remove the MySQL database used as cache in the Live extraction; the second is to create an administrative interface where the user will be able to start, stop, queue items and explore a variety of statistics. To remove the MySQL database Iâ€™ll introduce an instance of a NoSQL database, MongoDB. The administrative interface will use the open source library Jetty and the real-time updates will be implemented using AJAX.
