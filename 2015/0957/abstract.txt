WebLogo is designed to easily generate a graphical representation of RNA, DNA, or protein multiple sequence alignments. WebLogo’s sequence logos provide a richer and more precise description of    sequence similarity than consensus sequences, and WebLogo rapidly reveals significant features of the alignment otherwise difficult to perceive. WebLogo’s web site is available to all users without a fee, or WebLogo’s source code can be run on a local server.
