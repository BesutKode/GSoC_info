OSUOSL  hosts  variety of systems in itâ€™s data center which include a wide array of vendors . Each of these machines utilize some type of out-of-band technology such as iLO or iDrac which allows direct access to the machine power and  other features. Unfortunately each OOB tool is different between the command line access and the console access. OSUOSL have begun work on an IPMI management tool, and would like to integrate SNMP functionality with this to create a unified OOB management tool.
