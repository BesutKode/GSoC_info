Currently, IPv6 can be "broken" in a number of different ways and although some statistics are being reported about IPv6 brokeness (http://goo.gl/WfEO0), however, there is still no automatic way of investigating the root cause, which typically requires to manually perform and correlate different measurements.  For this GSOC, I would like to extend nmap’s IPv6 support, with particular focus on the “IPv6 brokenness”. I also list some ideas for new scripts that could be discussed with the mentors.
