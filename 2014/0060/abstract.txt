This proposal is the development of a web interface for The Cancer Network Altering Variant Database using traditional search and browse methods combined with a comparative visualization of the interaction networks between both wild type and mutant proteins involved with cancers. Being able to visualize the differences between cancerous and wild type protein-protein interaction networks would help researchers gain understanding of how cancers develop and have an effect on the protein level.
