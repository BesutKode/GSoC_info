BinPy is at a nascent stage now. Many more fundamental concepts and implementations can be done. In my project I propose to strengthen the core of BinPy by implementing as many as possible concepts to realize the objective of BinPy, i.e to virtualize electronics. I wish to strengthen core libraries to the extent that simulation of as many basic digital circuits / algorithms can be done via binpy.
