The GNSS-SDR project includes excellent libraries for performing navigation operation through software. In order to keep GNSS-SDR libraries fresh this project propose to include on it a nouvelle technique that will reduce the computational complexity of the signal acquisition by 2.2 times. The proposal is based on the work developed in http://people.csail.mit.edu/fadel/papers/quicksync-paper.pdf.
