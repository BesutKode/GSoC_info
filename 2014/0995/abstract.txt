Hair/Fur rendering is a very important requirement for any production renderer. Hair is usually modelled mathematically as a curve. Analytical intersection of rays with curves is quite involved. Further, production rendering requires efficient representation, storage, intersection and shading. This project would involve researching into all these aspects and would culminate in adding support for curve rendering in appleseed.
