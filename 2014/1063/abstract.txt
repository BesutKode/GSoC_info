I am a past OPW intern (round 6). During my internship, I worked to parallelize the x86 boot process. This meant understanding and modifying very low level bring up code. I contributed 34 patches to the 3.11 kernel. I would like to keep contributing to Linux kernel and I am interested in parallel xenwatch kthread project. I took operation systems, distributed systems and applications classes last year, so I have basic understanding on locks. I think I am qualified for this project.
