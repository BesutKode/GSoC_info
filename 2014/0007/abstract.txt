The process of clustering assigns similar objects to the same group and dissimilar objects to different groups and the resulting data partition enhances data understanding. In biological domains, we are often interested in determining the group structure in data but the results can depend on chosen method's assumptions. Algorithms need to be compared on the basis of desirable clustering features, and outline algorithmsâ€™ benefits and drawbacks to match them to biomedical applications.
