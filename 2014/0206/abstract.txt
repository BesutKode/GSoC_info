The DynamoRIO cache consistency strategy is not the most efficient for dynamically generated code. To optimize: (1) implement an annotation framework similar to Valgrind's, allowing the target app to specify dynamic code regions; (2) use this information in the optimization from issue #1114: writes to pre-flushed regions are redirected to a writable "view" of the same target address range; (3) extend this optimization to all apps by inferring dynamic code regions from observed app behavior.
