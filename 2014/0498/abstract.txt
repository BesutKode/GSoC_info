Geppetto is the simulation engine developed by OpenWorm, an organization attempting to build the first cell-by-cell simulation of the nematode C. elegans. The project aims at enabling Geppetto to replay simulations from popular neural simulators (Neuron, Brian, ...). Firstly, the output of these simulators will be investigated with simple neuron models. Secondly, Python scripts will be developed that transform the output to Geppetto's format. Finally, documentation for researchers will be added.
