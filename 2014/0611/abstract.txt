Several variants of LSH-ANN methods will be prototyped and evaluated. After Identifying the best method, hashing algorithms will be implemented. Then with the results got from prototyping stage, storing and querying structure of ANN will be implemented. After that ANN part will be integrated into sklearn.neighbors module. As these activities proceed, testing, examples and documentation will be covered. Bench marking will be done to assess the implementation.
