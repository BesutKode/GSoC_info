POMDPs provide a principled mathematical framework for planning and decision-making in uncertain and dynamic environment, which is essential for autonomous systems. PRISM hasnâ€™t supported model checking for POMDPs yet. With some new efficient POMDP algorithms invented in recent years, it is possible to extend PRISM for POMDPs. In this project, I propose to develop a prototypical PRISM extension for POMDPs.
