Enabling robots to automatically locate and pick up randomly placed objects from a bin is crucial in factory automation replacing tedious and heavy manual labor. Similar tools are also capable of guiding impaired people/robots through unstructured environments (automated navigation). These make 3D matching a ubiquitous necessity. Within the context of this application, I will be proposing an OpenCV implementation of a 3D object recognition and pose estimation algorithm using 3D point features.
