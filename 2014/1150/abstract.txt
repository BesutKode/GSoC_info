This project aims to bring in some enhancements to make the Knitting experience of MapKnitter more friendly and easier. 
This project will make two enhancements.
1. Enhancing the upload interface(multiple image upload, multiple knitter image selection and display, drag-drop).
2. Add feature in MapKnitter to auto-knit images as much as possible using relevant EXIF metadata from the images like latitude, longitude, altitude and orientation.
