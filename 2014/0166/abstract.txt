The main goal of this proposal is to implement a time-series visualizer for 4D data in TVB, which would enable users to work with their functional MRI data directly from the browser.
Then I will work on rewriting some of the visualizers that are currently implemented using MatplotLib and MPLH5, backed with web-friendly tools.
