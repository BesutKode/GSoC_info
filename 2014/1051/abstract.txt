Improperly handled email bounces can cause for a lot of resource wastage, specially for a vast community like Wikipedia which handles tonnes of mails daily. A return bounce is generated to the sender address (wiki@wikimedia.org) on an email delivery failure and currently, its forwarded to /dev/null. VERP implementation can help in finding out and un-confirming email address of failing recipients.
