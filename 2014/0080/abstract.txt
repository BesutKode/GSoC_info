This project is called "Firefox OS Games Resources" and the objective is to create game samples, an ebook and some reusable libraries to aid game developers in Firefox OS. 

Games count for 50% of the app usage on smartphones, we don't have developer resources and training material to help developers build good quality games for Firefox OS low-end devices. This project aims to fix that and help our platform advance further.
