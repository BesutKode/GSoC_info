The goal of the project is to improve the CodeCombat level editor from a usability point of view. The current editor is versatile and powerful, but has a high barrier of entry. 

I'll be performing usability tests to determine the UI issues, and then design and implement a more intuitive interface for the editor. I'll also work on reducing the inherent difficulty and tediousness involved in designing a new level from scratch.
