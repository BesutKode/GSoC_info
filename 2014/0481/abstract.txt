Windows is the most widespread operating system: it is critical for Project Tox to properly support the Windows platform. There are already two Tox GUI clients which support Windows: Venom and Qt GUI. Unfortunately, neither of these clients are suitable for widespread adoption on Windows. My proposal is to create a new Tox client which will be suitable for widespread adoption on Windows.
