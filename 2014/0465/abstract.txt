The tentative areas of work shall be: Gaussian Hypergeometric Functions (2F1) and Spherical Harmonic Functions. The implementation of the hypergeometric functions in scipy.special is lacking in several respects, and is not optimal in many parameter regimes. Focus shall be to seal the present loop holes. Further Spherical harmonic function shall be enhanced as with the use of recurrence relation, also function to evaluate ellipsoidal harmonic function shall be created.
