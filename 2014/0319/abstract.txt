In this proposal, I give a brief outline of the scheduling of my project for the Google Summer of Code 2014. First of all, I will focus in contribute to OpenCV tutorials of how to manage with the 3D reconstruction API in order to guide the developers how to estimate the 3D position of an object from a 2D image. Secondly, I will focus the work in the implementation in OpenCV format the Direct Least-Squares (DLS) method.
