I would like to support the progress of the IMEX project by further developing the current proof of concept model, adding several options to increase the modelâ€™s accurateness and to extend its field of application. These innovations pave the way for a broadly usable simulation tool that is able to predict and store the trajectories of large amounts of particles or light objects through the Solar System, utilizing the computation capability of the Constellation platform.
