The project mainly deals with the implementation of various links, knots presentations and calculating various related invariants.

The main aim of the project is to achieve :

Conversion between different representations of Knots and Links to mention a few :Gauss code to Braid Word, Braid word to DT code,Gauss code to DT code.

Implementation of various invariants :
Alexander Polynomial, Conway Polynomial. Stiefert Matrix, Jones Polynomial
