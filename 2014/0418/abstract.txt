A STEP-File is the most widely used data exchange form of STEP. These files are often huge and are heavily resource consuming when being imported. 
The performance can be improved by using multi-threading. But before doing that, it must ensured that the STEP libraries are thread safe or else we might run into hard to debug data races. 
Apart from that, some small tweaks can also be done to increase the performance of the single threaded code itself.
