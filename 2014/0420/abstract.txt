BioJS currently has support for Feature Tracks and BigWIG files. Those are enough to provide a minimum genome browser that includes coverage from alignments. However, detailed information about the alignments from NGS is not supported yet.  Most of the modern sequence aligners support BAM as the format output. The BAM format enables random queries, avoiding the necessity to load the whole alignment in memory. BAM File Viewer for BioJS will complement wigExplorer.
