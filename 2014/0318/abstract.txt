My proposal is to implement the Elektra framework in order to automatically merge changes in configuration files when upgrading packages in Debian. Currently when a package is update, grub for instance, the user is forced to decide whether to overwrite or keep their configuration, while the default configuration may have changed significantly or they must merge the configuration by hand. At the end of this summer, by implementing this framework, users would not have to face this scenario.
