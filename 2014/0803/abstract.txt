This project adds Redis and Openstack Swift to the existing stack of storage backends to OpenStack Marconi. Redis would help users in need of faster queuing operations while OpenStack Swift would help better integration of Marconi into the communityâ€™s product portfolio. The project also involves developing a benchmarking suite using autobench/tsung to measure the performance under various scenarios of transport, storage backends, and sharding options.
