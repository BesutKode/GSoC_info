I started to develop a simple sound library for Processing at the end of 2013.  The library is based on libMethCla, an extendable lightweight C++ sound engine. Low Latency and click free audio is already possible but more plugins and cross platform functionality have to be implemented. The library will provide enough flexibility to operate within the basic realms of digital music paradigms but should be stripped down to the essential functionality to provide easy access for non-professionals.
