This project will make p5.js a more robust resource for anyone who works with sound and data. I will develop tools that help creative programmers parse and build upon the vast amounts of data at our fingertips. I will also develop a sound library that helps users tap into the emerging potential of the Web Audio API. I will coordinate my efforts with existing projects, conduct research, test, document and demo to ensure that my work makes a lasting impact.
