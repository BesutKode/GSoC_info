Extend the capabilities of the shape tools in Pinta to make shapes editable after being drawn. Proposed to be done in 3 parts:

1. Making all of the shapes drawn by shape tools editable.

2. Merging these capabilities, allowing for editability to be maintained when switching between tools.

3. Realizing some of the possible shape creations and combinations that spawn as a result of this, such as octagons and curved, mixed, and custom shapes.
