The aim of the project is to implement certain fundamental ML algorithms, refactor code of certain existing algorithms to boost performance and create attractive ipython notebooks. We propose to implement algorithms on decision tree learning and fast kernel density estimation. We also plan to refactor PCA, KPCA and LARS code to make use of Shogun's own eigensolver. Finally we plan to create notebooks with real-life examples on decision trees, KNN and regression techniques.
