ScribeUI is a Mapfile editing and management GUI that was developed last year as a project for the Google Summer of Code 2013. It is a very useful tool for map edition and creation and supports a new mapfile syntax that makes map editing much easier and faster.
The project needs some more work done to really shine. The goals of this project is to get scribeui to a state of stability, along with an easy to follow install procedure.
