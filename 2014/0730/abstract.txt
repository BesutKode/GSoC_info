Variation, a Cytoscape 3 app under development, will enable users to load genetic variation data from multiple sources (Ensembl, ADAM, and GEMINI) and integrate them to create visual mappings for these variations. I would like to contribute by implementing the variation service based on ADAM, a set of formats and APIs for distributed processing of genomic file formats. In addition, Iâ€™d like to add visualization support for variation counts and consequences at the gene level.
