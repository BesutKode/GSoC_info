Design and implementation of a core HTTP server on Boost that can be embedded in other projects (and can co-exist with other embeddable communication facilities) on top of Boost ASIO. The server will expose the HTTP power (chunking, pipelining, persistent streams, continue, protocol upgrades, ...) and allow multiple backends (CoAP, built in server, ...) while keep a modular design to allow the library be used in resource-constrained devices.
