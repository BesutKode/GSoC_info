As proposed by Eclipse the idea would be to extend the EASE script interpreter for
Python with debugging functionality using parts of the existing JavaScript debugger as
well as the Jython debugging package. The main goal is to provide a full Eclipse
plugin that offers all necessary Python/Jython debugging functionality.
