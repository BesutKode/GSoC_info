The idea I want is Anonymous mode and autosharing for phimpme Android app.
The features I planned to develop are
1. Share over NFC, Wi-Fi Direct, and Bluetooth
2. Support shared folders, public ftp
3. Sharing works without Internet
4. Auto-connect and broadcast
5. “Shake-and-share”
I am the best person, because
1. I have the experience of hacking NFC, Bluetooth, and FTP.
2. I have the knowledge and experience
3. I'm a quick learner
4. I love programming and try to be perfect
