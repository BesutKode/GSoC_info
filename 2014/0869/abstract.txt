LiDAR has become an important technology in topographic mapping and city modelling since it can provide high-quality 3D representations of the world - point couds. Now it's essential to allow Opticks to retrieve the thematic information that these point clouds supply: my idea is to develop an Opticks Plug-In for the building roof segmentation for LiDAR point cloud data, implementing the RANSAC and the PCA algorithms which can be successfully applied to the problem of building roof segmentation.
