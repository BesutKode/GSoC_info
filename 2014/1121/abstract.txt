Many operations on bytearrays internally make unnecessary copies, thus causing the complexity of these operations to be incorrect.  The first part of this project will be fixing these operations.

The representation of unicode strings on PyPy, at both the interpreter and application-level, is platform-dependant.  The second part of this project will be to move unicode strings to UTF-8 internally with an application-level UTF-32/"wide-build" interface.
