Edge-aware filters are very powerful tool for various applications. Nevertheless, today in OpenCV they are presented  by only one simple method â€“ bilateral filtering. But recent many novel edge-aware filters was presented, for example:	Guided Filter, Domain Transform Filter, Constant Time Weighted Median Filter. This methods have less computational complexity and produce better result in some applications than bilateral filter. Therefore this filters must be presented in OpenCV.
