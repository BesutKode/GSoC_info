DHIS2 (District Health Information System 2) is an open source tool for data collection, validation, analyses, presentation of data aggregation and statistical reports for integrated health information management system. The main goal of this GsoC project would be to enable all Android devices to send the data to DHIS2 server using the ODKCollect XFORM client utility. The DHIS2 server will be extended to be able to receive the XFORM and import the data into DHIS2 database.
