The goal of this project will be to write a Ceylon module that can be used to construct a Ceylon Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using Ceylonâ€™s named arguments syntax. This AST can then be fed directly into the compiler or into my ceylon.formatter to write the AST as regular Ceylon code (nicely formatted) to a file. This can be used to avoid writing repetitive code.
