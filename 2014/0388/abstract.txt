The aim of the project is to implement an application using Eden which makes it easier to deploy instances of Sahana Eden remotely on Amazon EC2 instances or Generic Linux Servers. The app may be used by deployers locally to create new deployments and may further be evolved to be used as a co-app that may be deployed along with the Eden instance to allow its configuration using a WebUI.
