Systers has sub-groups (Latinas in Computing, LGBT, Black Women in Computing, and others) and would like to have one portal where all could access to find community information, resources, local events, etc. Moderators want a central location where they could provide information for their sub-group or main Systers to include events, resources, etc.
A portal for Systers and sub-groups to share information to perspective communities, lists events and by geography.
