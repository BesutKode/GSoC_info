Using the latest SDSS DR10 data, we provide color composite images and scientifically-calibrated FITS mosaics in all SDSS imaging bands, for all the RC3 galaxies that lie within the surveyâ€™s footprint. Due to the positional inaccuracy inherent in the RC3 catalog, the mosaicking program uses a recursive algorithm for positional update first, then conduct the mosaicking procedure.The program is generalized into a pipeline,which can be easily extended to future survey data or other source catalogs.
