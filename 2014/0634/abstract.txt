My project proposal concerns the development of an OSSIM App for Digital Surface Models (DSMs) generation using high resolution satellite imagery. Such a task is not a trivial one and several complex processing steps are required; I would like to mix the OSSIM functionalities with the algorithms implemented in the OpenCV library in order to exploit the combined capabilities in a synergistic way.
