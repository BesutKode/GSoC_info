My proposal aims at implementing a semi-automatic generator of language lessons for Parley. Currently, all the lessons have to be made manually by the creator, which includes adding translations in multiple languages, sound, images, etc. This semi-automatic generator uses the KexiDB libraries to store data after fetching it from online resources, such as OmegaWiki, WikiMedia etc. Should time permit, another feature I plan to work on is extending kvtml to support a container for media resources.
