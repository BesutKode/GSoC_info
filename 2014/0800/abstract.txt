The overall objective of the project is to develop a framework which enables Round trip conversion from Lyx to ODT. Framework should be planned in such a way that it is backend independent so that the same framework with appropriate changes can be used after deciding the feature set of the some other conversion. Final outcome of the project will be a robust conversion tool from Lyx to ODT and a prototype of the reverse conversion tool.
