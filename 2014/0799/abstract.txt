There are lots of gadgets around us that are Digital Media Servers (or DMSes) - cameras, smartphones, tablets, laptops, network-attached storage, etc.. Content hosted on them can be accessed from other devices, such as game consoles, home theatres, stereos, video displays and TVs. With this project, we want to turn GNOME Photos into a Digital Media Player (or DMP) that can browse DMSes on a local network.
