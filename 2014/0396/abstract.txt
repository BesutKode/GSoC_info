Kernel Current Source Density Method is a recently developed method for estimating the density of trans-membrane current sources, which is useful for the study of neuronal synaptic dynamics. The method involves inverting a forward modeling scheme which is different depending on the dimensionality of electrodes distribution. The aim of this project is to create an object oriented python implementation of the method with a coherent design, that would also address the performance issues.
