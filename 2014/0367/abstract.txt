In this project I will work on extending its support across mobile platforms. I will be using Apache Cordova, Ionic Framework which is build over AngularJS. Major advantage of using Ionic Framework is that the Community-App is also made in AngularJS so the logic (controllers, services, directives etc.) will almost remain same, just major changes will be changing the views. This way it will be easier to manage the code and we will be efficiently reusing the existing code.
