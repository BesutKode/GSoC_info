In biological networks, identification of  shortest paths between proteins may help to detect and score highly communicating nodes. Pesca currently supports single-source shortest path problem, single-destination shortest path problem and finding SP clusters for undirected graphs. Adding additional features to the app like support for directed and weighted graphs as well as provision to download the human interactome would highly increase the application of the app in the biological world.
