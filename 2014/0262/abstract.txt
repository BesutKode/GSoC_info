The analysis of functional data has received considerable attention over recent years.  It  arises when the response variable of interest can be measured continuously, often over time.   The aim of the project is to develop a package  in R to produce kernel density estimates and statistical discrimination rules based on samples of  functional data. Such functions, which utilise the true nature of functional data, are currently not available.
