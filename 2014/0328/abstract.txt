Since a data centre houses machines from a variety of vendors, there is a need to have direct access to these machinesâ€™ power, console etc. via a tool that is vendor agnostic. This project aims to implement such a tool with the aid of IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface). The intention is to develop an application that would facilitate connection to every machine over IPMI to perform tasks like accessing the serial console, power cycling the machine, getting sensors values and so on.
