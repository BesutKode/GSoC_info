The project consists of an iOS Application to help the Peace Corps in their mission of Malaria Prevention. The project has to work on three sides - the Peace Corps Volunteer side iOS Application, Android Application, and the HQ side web dashboard. I would be working on the iOS side. The application would be implemented up on existing designs contributed by the design team, and  built thereafter. The aim is to come up with a user friendly implementation, that could reach out to maximum users.
