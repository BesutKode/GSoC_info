A CAD kernel is one which manages the various operations such as scale, move, copy, trim, rotate. It manages the entities, attributes of entities and the data/information of the entity. It also manages the way the data is stored in memory and how the data will be written to a file (file format) or stored in a database. This project will extend the new completely rewritten kernel so as to stand as the base for the new LibreCAD.
