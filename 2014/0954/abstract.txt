The idea of this project is to drop the current way to use the KIPI export tool, which is via a separate dialog box and to integrate those KIPI tool components in Batch Queue Manager (BQM). All the available KIPI tools that will be exported successfully, will be visible in the “Control Panel” section of the BQM dialog box and these exported KIPI tools will be used like any other BQM tool.
