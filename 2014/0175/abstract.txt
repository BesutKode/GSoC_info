The Internet Of Things gets more important in upcoming developments. Particularly portable objects must know their position within their area of movement to act in a smart way. Apple's new "iBeacons" use Bluetooth Low Energy to send nearby devices proximity information. Localization algorithms like the ones included in the Wiselib can use such input information to calculate the receiver's position. Therefore this project aims to integrate the iBeacon protocol into the Wiselib.
