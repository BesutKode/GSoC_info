Software engineering relies heavily on thorough testing. This is especially true for systems programming. The goal of this project is to produce a small piece of software that will leverage historical testing data from mysql-test runs on MariaDB, so that instead of using a ‘brute force’ approach and running as many test suites as possible, we can intelligently select a smaller set of test suites that are more likely to find defects.
