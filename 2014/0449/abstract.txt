Autocompletion of fields in Semantic Forms is one of the most important feature which allows users to see what the previously-entered values were for a given field, this greatly helps to avoid issues of naming ambiguity, spelling, etc. The goal of this project is to switch the currently available autocompletion in Semantic Forms from jQuery UI Autocomplete to Select2 which is much more complete library for autocompletion.
