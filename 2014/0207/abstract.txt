As part of my GSoC 2012 project, we created samba-regedit, a tool for interactively browsing and editing the Samba registry in the console. In its current state, it has a useable interface, but itâ€™s very basic. This project will improve the regedit TUI by adding a color scheme and other refinements. Another aim is to add a DCERPC winreg backend, so users can use regedit to access remote registries.
