CodeCombat currently does not offer the users to code on their mobile devices. This proposal designs an editor that allows mobile coding taking into consideration the limitations such as the work that is connected to writing longer texts on the small keyboards. To achieve a better experience the design tries to make the user type as little as possible and get the most useful code out of it. For this it relies on extensive knowledge about the code to offer help and reduce typing.
