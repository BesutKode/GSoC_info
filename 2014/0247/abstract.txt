The goal is to create a basic solution for creating, managing, and organizing forms in Neos easily by using its powerful TYPO3.Form.FormBuilder as a backend module. This module should have a simple way to create new forms, browse and manage already created forms. The solution should be usable and friendly to all beginners. Users should be able to categorize forms and search by those categories.
