Beneficiaries of packages of differential equations come from a multitude of disciplines. I propose to develop, in MATHEMAGIX, a package for the symbolic computation of solutions of linear differential systems based on cutting-edge research. The acclaimed package ISOLDE is developed by my mentor for the popular proprietary computer algebra system MAPLE. However, MATHEMAGIX provides, under GNU General Public License, a new high-level general purpose language for symbolic and numeric algorithms.
