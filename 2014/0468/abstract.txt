Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) facilitate workflows and provide reliable sample and data tracking for laboratory environments. As demands evolve the concept of a LIMS is expanding. There are no open source LIMS currently available that offer spatial functionality. Developing a mapping platform within a LIMS for analysis of sample locations will introduce a powerful data mining tool for its users.
