Joomla CLI App Suite (JACS - Joomla Application Control Scripts) is a command line shell and scripting interface for Joomla. There are presently very few scripts available for the JACS however there are a number of scripts that are developed by different people over time. These scripts need to be collected and restructured to bring under JACS. In order to build a complete CLI App Suite, building new scripts is also important as there are endless possibilities of the things that can be done.
