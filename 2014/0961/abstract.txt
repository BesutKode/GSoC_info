At the Institute of Perception and Visualization Research (IVPR),we are looking to develop a web-based framework, interfaces and architecture to communicate with external analytical platforms. With this ability genomic analytical platforms can be harnessed and computational results ultimately analyzed visually using our Web-based Analytic and Visualization Environment (Weave), a high performance, open source, interactive visualization and analysis also being developed at the IVPR since 2008.
