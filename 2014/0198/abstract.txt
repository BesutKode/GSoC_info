The Wiselib offers great support for accessing block devices such as SD cards and hard disks through the block memory concept. SD cards contain an embedded Flash Translation Layer that cares to adapt these different storage concepts to each other, and can also care for wear levelling, bad-block remapping and caching. This project proposal entails the implementation of a lightweight flash controller for the Wiselib in software that can be used to enable use of this memory.
