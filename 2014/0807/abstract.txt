In this proposal, a new Oculus Rift library for Processing is proposed. Oculus Rift is a novel approach of providing a different dimension of interaction with the user, and its integration to the existing creative coding framework will provide exciting ways for artists to harness this interaction. Also the project scope includes updating TUIO client and MSAFluid libraries for Processing 2.0
