To apply new strong gravitational lensing time delay measurements which can enable constraints on dark energy. Quasar variability can be used to measure the time delay between two or more quasar images in a strongly lensed system. To achieve precision cosmological constraints, the error on this measurement needs to be reduced. The proposed approach will reduce this error for finding time delays. This project will also perform model based identification of strong gravitational lenses in Images.
