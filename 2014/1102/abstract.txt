MediaWiki's user guide for core and those for extensions (like VisualEditor) each have a large number of images illustrating functions. However, these often date quickly as the software changes, and are generally only available in English, which means that non-English users are not as well served. Hence my GSOC project deals with creation of automated system which capture the current look of the software with screenshots across the hundreds of languages that MediaWiki supports.
