My project aims at improving the linear modelling in scikit-learn, by implementing the following goals.

1. Random / Cyclic co-ordinate descent


2. Finishing Gael's Logistic Regression CV PR


3. Finishing Larsman's Multiomial Regression PR + MultinomialRegressionCV


4. Strong Rules for (ElasticNet + Lasso) and (ElasticNetCV + LassoCV)


5. (L1 + L2) regression using CDN


6. Fixing all issues that I might face while dealing with the above goals.
