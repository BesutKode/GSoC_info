The code provided in sympy.physics.mechanics currently makes it very easy to generate the equations of motion (EOM) for the dynamics of rigid, multibody systems. However, these EOM are typically nonlinear in nature. For analysis, linearizing the equations about equilibrium points, or trajectories is desired. The intent of this project is to create a linearization routine capable of handling multiple varieties of systems of equations correctly, in a way transparent to the user.
