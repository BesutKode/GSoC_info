Objective of this project is to create RTEMS port for mikroprocesor core Cortex R4F.  
Microprocesor core Cortex R4F is designed for safety enhanced application which make it great choice for automotive and other safety critical application. 
My task would be to prepare RTEMS for running on the Cortex â€“ R4 Ti Hercules family core. This will highly increase development and production speed of anyone using microprocessor of the mentioned family.
