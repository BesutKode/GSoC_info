Hardware Detection for Libre-Mesh has born as an idea to simplify node installation. As example, hitherto, if an additional external USB radio is needed to the router you must configure it manually in order to use it. Thanks to the development of this proposal will be implemented an hardware detection module for Libre-Mesh which will detect and configure the external USB radios and other hardware units. Therefore, the system will be configurated automatically.
