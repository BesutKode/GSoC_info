Astropy is a project to establish a convenient and powerful framework for astronomy related data analysis. Astronomical data in most cases is a representation of physical measurement. Any such measurement has an intrinsic uncertainty which must be handled properly throughout any computations for the result to have physical meaning. The proposal here suggests a framework allowing the propagation of uncertainty within Astropy and outlines the steps to achieve it.
