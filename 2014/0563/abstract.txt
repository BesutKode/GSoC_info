One aspect of AGI that the OpenCog Foundation is currently addressing is language learning. My project will be to develop and implement steps towards AGI language learning of Tagalog morphology. This will be done within the context of OpenCogâ€™s current processes and outlined steps for learning the syntax of a language. The major hurdle of my project will be devising a method for precisely splitting Tagalog words at morpheme boundary locations, prior to the application of links between morphemes.
