As of now NS-3 is not supporting MLDv2 or PIM-SM. As a result of this we are setting up the routes manually . In real life  nodes join and leave different multicast groups quite frequently and they also  mention the sources in which they are interested in. By using this information  there is lot of scope for optimization of the multicast traffic .My proposal is to make the NS-3 support to Multicast more realistic by implementing MLDv2 protocol.
