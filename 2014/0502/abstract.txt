I plan to improve the accuracy and usefulness of the software that has been developed as part of the “IMEX Comet trails” project at the Institute of Space Systems. To achieve this, I will evaluate and implement modules that take additional orbital perturbations into account. Depending on project progress, I will also work on improving the usability and scalability of the software by implementing means to visualize the data that is generated and by improving data handling.
