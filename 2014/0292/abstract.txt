Currently there is standalone web-app and used for importing bulk data like clients, groups, loan and saving accounts and transactions into the system. But this standalone web application doesn’t provide import functionalities for full database. When migrating from one database to another database it’ll be easy to use data import/export tool rather than manual data extraction and configurations. Also since it is standalone web app, it’s hard to integrate with the community app.
