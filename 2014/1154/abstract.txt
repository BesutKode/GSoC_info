kdeconnect is a library which allows us to fuse our devices with KDE . For now, we already have an android integration which allows users to get all the device notifications from their KDE notification center, synchronise the clipboard etc. It's a project highly and seamless integrated with KDE in order to simplify our daily tasks. The main purpose of this project is to integrate the iOS platform with the Plasma desktop using libraries like libimobiledevice and kdeconnect.
