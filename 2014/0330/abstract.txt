Boost.Thread and std::thread have provided C++ programmers with a mechanism to easily create threads.

Unfortunately the management of these threads is still largely left to the programmer to handle.

Scheduled executors, are mechanisms which can schedule work for execution, either synchronously or asynchronously. The key feature of scheduled executors is the ability to schedule a work unit at an exact time point in order to guarantee that certain work units are executed before other.
