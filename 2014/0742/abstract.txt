Processing uses GStreamer to implement a video library. To be able to do this from Java, it needs a binding library, which is currently gstreamer-java. However, GStreamer 0.10, the latest version usable with gstreamer-java, is not supported anymore. Its replacement, the 1.x series, is API incompatible with 0.10, thus, until a gstreamer-java rewrite, Processing is locked to the unsupported 0.10 series. This project consists of this rewrite, and integrating the new library into Processing.
