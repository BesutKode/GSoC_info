Python is an important platform for memory-constrained mobile devices such as mobile phones and PDAs. PyPy is a fast python interpreter written in RPython. However the current GCs still suffer high space overhead .This project proposed incremental mark and copy garbage collector to reduce the current GCs  memory consumption and make a new garbage collector suitable for mobile devices.
