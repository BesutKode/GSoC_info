This project is based on the project idea to introduce GStreamer 1.0 support into the MATE desktop environment in order to replace dependency on the deprecated GStreamer 0.10 library.

As port to the current GStreamer 1.0 is not feasible due to removed functionality, this project is based on an alternative approach to develop a new library abstracting access to lower level libraries that provide equivalent functionality supported on modern desktop Linux/UNIX operating systems.
