Adapt the build of about 60 Debian packages, adding new build profiles for limited-feature builds with fewer dependencies.  Test the resulting package set for linear buildability without dependency cycles.  Submit the modifications as patches to the Debian packages using the Debian Bug Tracking System and discuss them with the corresponding package maintainers, making additional changes as needed.
