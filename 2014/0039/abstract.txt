The goal of this project is to design a string interpolator for XML using the support of macros in Scala. The aim is to eliminate native support for XML literals in Scala and find a replacement which solely relies on macro expansion which results in better code generation and static type checking. Since it is to be a replacement for the XML literal syntax of Scala, the goal is to provide all the already existing features of that syntax as well.
