The DHIS2 project is a complex project. How for any project, small, or big needs to be tested, and also DHIS2 to become the system that it is today has passed through thousands of tests. They are using unit testing in code, but don't have integration tests or tests in the UI. The goal is to be able to automate the scripts using Selenium2, so that the programmers can write functional tests that will be automated also using SauceLabs and run over a  CI system or just in a local machine.
