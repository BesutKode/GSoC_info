Currently, syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (hereinafter referred to as "AMQP") only as destination driver. The working group of AMQP project contains big names of the IT industry (for example: Cisco Systems, Microsoft Corporation, Red Hat) and the AMQP is used widespreadly. These factors encourage us to implement the source driver, which can receive and interpret any message which conforms to the defined data format by the AMQP standard.
