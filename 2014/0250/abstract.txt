debile is a platform which aims to provide a generic rebuild platform. Normal build, custom builds (clang based) or static analyzers (coccinelle, scan-build, etc) are managed through this infrastructure. 

This project aims to provide metrics for the packages being build by debile, with graphical visualizations.
