Currently, the vector calculus package of sympy, sympy.physics.vector lacks one important thing - compatiblity with the SymPy mainframe. Any person not acquainted with the physics module has no vector framework to work with in SymPy. I want take up this project, a logical continuation of Prasoon and my last year's work, to finally help it end up as a 'vector' package in the top-level sympy hierarchy. The project will also involve basing the mechanics code off the new module.
