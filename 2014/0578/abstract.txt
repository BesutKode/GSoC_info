The task of this project is to generate natural English sentence(s) using RelEx [1] and the Link Parser [2] and some graph similarity computing algorithm. Ideally, when we input the RelEx relationships produced by applying RelEx to a sentence, the NL generation system will generate one or more natural, well-formed sentence(s), which have the same meaning as the original sentence. It focuses on improving the work that I have done for the OpenCog GsoC 2009 [5]
