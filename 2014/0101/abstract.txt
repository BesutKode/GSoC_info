FFmpeg Integration
CCExtractor has built in parser (demuxer and decoder) to separates out the Subtitle Streams.  Currently CCExtractor have few parser. 
The project Idea aims to integrate ffmpeg with ccextractor , so that subtitle streams from all the ffmpeg supported file formats are available to ccextractor for processing.

Support for DVB:
CCExtractor does not have support for DVB subtitle, after adding DVB support CCExtractor would be able to extract Subtitle even in DVB format.
