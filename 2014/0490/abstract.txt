Escape from Monkey Island (EMI) support is currently incomplete in ResidualVM. This project intends to improve the playability of the game in ResidualVM by completing stubbed functions in the Lua scripting engine, solving graphical bugs and fixing game logic issues. This work will be completed through reverse engineering the original EMI binary and rewriting missing functionality as well as play testing the game in ResidualVM.
