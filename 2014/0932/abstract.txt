Assimilation (understanding the gist) of texts is believed to be the main application of online machine translation. Language pairs may be evaluated to see how well they perform in this task. The proposed toolkit will automatically generate tasks for human evaluation given parallel texts and a corresponding language pair. The toolkit will include different types of tasks and will be available through different interfaces.
