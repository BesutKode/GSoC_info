The project is about writing a visualization framework to represent the evolution of tumor in a network representation where nodes and links represents mutations and evolutionary relationships respectively. Currently, the tool outputs the network representation using python's pygraphviz library which it refers as partial order plots. The current network representation is pretty basic and it needs to be improved to convey the information to the medical users in a better way.
