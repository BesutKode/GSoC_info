This proposal is aimed at refactor the OModel for ODE project. Current OModel is not evolveable. When BPEL evolves, new version of OModel objects fail on backward compatibility and compiler/runtime is not flexible enough to the OModel changes like new extension support. I propose JSON serialization and extension plugin mechanism for them respectively. It will reduces work needed for later migrations.
