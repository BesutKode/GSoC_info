The goal of this project is to impliment a matrix library with bitslicing techniques described by Tom Boothby and Robert Bradshaw  here http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1413.    This takes the “Method of Four Russians”, an algorithm made for efficient  logical matrix  algorithms, and using bitslicing to extend that to matrices over  finite fields. GF(3), GF(5), and GF(7) matrices will be the scope of this project.
