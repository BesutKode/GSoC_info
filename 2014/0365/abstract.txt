Currently, when the user enables the  Linux Flattened Device Tree Self-checking tests, it is required to manually append the board device tree with the testcase data. As there are many platforms, so each platform has its own device tree structure. In this project above mentioned manual addition of testcase data, would be automated irrespective of the platform. Further the self checking testcases would be improved and extended as appropriate.
