Currently, Mixxx lacks a couple of effects such as Phaser, Brake Gater or Vocal Cut whereas other major DJ Mixing products already provide similar effects.
This project aims at implementing some effects and also change the back end to support a new class of effects. These new features are going to boost Mixxx's visibility.
