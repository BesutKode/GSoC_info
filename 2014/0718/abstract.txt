WordPressâ€™ Theme Customizer is key to the project's long-term success due the context that it provides for making changes to sites. The Widget Customizer was introduced in WordPress 3.9, adding the ability to edit and live-preview widgets in the customizer. The Menu Customizer, proposed here, would similarly add Menu Management to the Customizer, simplifying the menu-management process. Successful completion of this project would help the Customizer to evolve into a contextual site-editing mode.
