This GSOC project aims to detect broken and deprecated wikitext found on wiki pages and in some cases, possible fixups, using Parsoid. During parsing, Parsoid has access to this information that can help wiki editors know where broken wikitext is and how they can fix it. This tool might be quite useful for the community by communicating this information to wiki editors. This tool will also help Parsoid developers to collect statistics about use of templates in balanced / unbalanced contexts.
