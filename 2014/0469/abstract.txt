The University of Massachusetts Lowell has been developing Weave, a web-based visualization and analysis platform (www.iweave.org), over the past five and a half years.  What I propose to do is move the current prototype Weave InfoMaps implementation into releasable code.  InfoMaps allows for the viewing and organizing multiple queries from a text corpus.  I plan to refine the interface and user experience and also extend it to work with a single record view.
