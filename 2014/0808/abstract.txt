The MediaWiki Translate extension provides an interface for translation of wiki pages. But it takes a lot of effort for the page under question to be converted into a format that would be recognized by the Translate extension. The process of preparing the page for translation needs to take into consideration various markups. Plus, wikis have a lot of legacy content needing translation. With this motivation, the project aims to automate the entire process and save manual effort.
