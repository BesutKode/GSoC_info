Thrust is the library for parallel algorithm and Data structure. Thrust provide the STL like API for GPU programming that helps programmer to develop the high performance application which exploit parallelism with minimum programmer effort. Thrust use the CUDA for NVDIA GPU and TBB or OpenMP for multi-core CPU as backend but there is no backend implemented in HPX for thrust.These project is intended to implement the backend for thrust in HPX.
