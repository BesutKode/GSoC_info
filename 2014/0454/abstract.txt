This is a project to add many small features & get rid of many small bugs in Nmap, each expected to take only a few days, allowing for many to be handled over the summer. It will involve contributing to a wide variety of the Nmap code base rather than working on just one subsystem. 
When a high-priority bug is discovered, it will be my role to solve it. 
The exact tasks cannot be itemized in advance (but some are in Project Proposal). The deliverables are the bug fixes and the new features.
