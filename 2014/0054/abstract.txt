The goal of this project is to improve history reordering and make the most of it. Automatic history reordering is an operation that is the basis of many commands of darcs. Then we want to add two features: a minimizing context feature for "darcs send", and a dependency graph generation that would enable a third party software and darcsden to visualize a darcs repository in a non-linear way. As a prelude to this work, we will measure and fix performance of automatic history reordering.
