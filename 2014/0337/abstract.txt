"[...] this project targets the implementation of a software based sound card for the Wiselib. [...] Since sensor nodes are resource constrained devices, this soundcard is not supposed to implement Dolby Surround or THX Sound, but rather a limited version of Midi and/or Wave Audio (e.g. 8-bit 11 kHz Mono). The sound should be generated using PWM on digital output pins or using analog output pins on the node. [...]"
