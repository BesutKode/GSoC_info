GRASS GIS is one of the core projects in the OSGeo Foundation. GRASS provides wide range of geospatial analyses including raster and vector analyses and image processing. However, there is no system for regular testing of it's algorithms. To ensure software quality and reliability, a standardized way of testing needs to be introduced. This project will implement a testing framework which can be used for writing and running tests of GRASS GIS modules, C/C++ libraries and Python libraries.
