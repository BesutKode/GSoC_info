We propose new cryptographic challenges for Hackademic. Each Challenge requires some understanding of cryptography and basic programming skills. The main motivation of these challenges is to explain students good implementation values, and common pitfalls. (NOTE: Due to the use of mathematical notations, the proposal here has been shortened. For Full the proposal, please refer to PDF file from the URL http://tinyurl.com/srm-hackademic.)
