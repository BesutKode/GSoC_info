Create the first Linux-based autopilot for flying robots using the BeagleBone and the BeagleBone Black as the "hardware blueprint". For this purpose I will focus on integrating ArduPilot (most popular autopilot) in the BeagleBone (Black). The main tasks performed will be userspace drivers development, the Robot Operative System Integration (ROS), web IDE exploration and security assessment.
