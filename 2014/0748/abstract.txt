Ontologies capture the tool and domain specific knowledge inside the OpenEngSB. This knowledge is used later for transformation, querying and validation of heterogeneous data. Having in mind the complexity and size of a typical automation system it is very important to choose an optimal architecture for the ontological system and proper querying techniques (with focus on performance and scalability).
