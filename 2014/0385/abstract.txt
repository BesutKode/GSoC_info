The LDV Tools allow to perform verification of almost all kernel modules from the last Linux kernel releases against a wide range of safety properties. The LDV Tools need about a month to perform full verification of kernel modules, since verification consumes a lot of time and memory. This project propose to prepare modules for verification in parallel and perform further verification on a cluster to drastically reduce spending time.
