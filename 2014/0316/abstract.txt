I will talk about my past, a quick brief on the work experience and give an overview of the projects I was involved on and languages and methodologies I am proficient with.
Then I will go and talk about the issue management integration.
I will implement features like:
> Fetching all issues from GitHub
> Filtering issues
> Creating new issues
> Closing issues
> Reassigning issues
and a few more features disclosed in the proposal.
