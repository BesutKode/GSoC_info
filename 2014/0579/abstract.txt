Many diseases have been shown to be associated with the disorder of the human microbiome using next generation sequencing.  Human microbiome biomarker discovery has attracted increasing attention.  We propose to use sparse regression model to achieve variable selection while accounting for the phylogenetic relationship among microbial taxa. Our 'PhyloVS' package aims at providing a fast and scalable toolkit to facilitate microbiome biomarker discovery.
