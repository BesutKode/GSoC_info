Recently, with the rapid development of cloud computing there is a huge movement towards distributed data aggregation and Big Data analytics. Although there are many tools that deal with the aggregation and visualization part, like Facebook’s Scribe or Twitter’s Zipkin there are few tools that deal with trace creation and how tracing can have the least possible overhead. I am interested in connecting LTTng’s low-impact nature with the scale and visualization capabilities of Scribe and Zipkin.
