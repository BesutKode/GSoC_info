Snipmatch (Code Recommenders incubator project) allows developers to search for code snippets. 
In the future Snipmatch would also like to help developers to share their knowledge and benefit themselves from the knowledge of others in form of code snippets.
Alas, the current implementation has some restrictions in relation to the sharing aspect. 
The goal is to improve Snipmatch to provide a powerful snippet sharing infrastructure to inspire people to share their snippets with the world.
