Extend LyX with interactivity capabilities allowing multiple users to work concurrently on the same LyX document. This is done by adding to LyX the capability to send/receive individual LyX actions (called LFUNs in the LyX gergo) through the network, by making use of some server allowing users to find each other.Through some extension in LyX GUI, remote users will be able to connect with each other and concurrently edit the same document.
