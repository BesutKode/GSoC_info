In essence, my project aims at building a GUI based simulator that would simulate underwater conditions with obstacles and enable navigation of the robot with motor controls, camera input and sensor input. It would help the user to build models, setup an environment, connect to ROS nodes, plan missions and would also provide presets for all the basic conditions that an AUV can face underwater. The whole software would be fully documented unlike the current simulators.
