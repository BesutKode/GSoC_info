The goal of the project is to help the JSBML community standardize the dynamic modeling of cellular population. The proposed project is intended to assist the JSBML community in the development of potential packages required for dynamic modeling of cellular population. Namely, the goal is to help the community with the arrays, dynamic structure, and hierarchical model composition packages.
