I am studying on master’s degree of Computer Engineering in National Technical University of Sevastopol on 4th year of education. I’ve been looking forward for participation in GSoC for a long time. I have been working for Sevntu.Checkstyle project already for one year. I’m interested in Checkstyle configuration for Google's Java Style guide and I want to get valuable experience in opensource development.
