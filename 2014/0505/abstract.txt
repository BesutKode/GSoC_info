The goal of my project is to create a Leaflet plugin using HTML <canvas> elements along with Fabric.js to allow users to annotate Leaflet maps, and then to integrate this plugin into MapKnitter.  This feature will improve the quality of maps produced using MapKnitter because users will be able to explain the purpose of their maps as well as construct more complete narratives using their maps.
