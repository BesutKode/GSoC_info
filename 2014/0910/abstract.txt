Traditional Crowdsourcing application does not have functionalities to tag multiple objects and generally focus only on the identification/classification of single object by the viewer. This project aims to develop a user interface which can enable a human user to easily view, identify, and tag multiple features within an image. The user will be able to select pre-assigned labels, as well as enter free-form text to describe unusual or interesting classes.
