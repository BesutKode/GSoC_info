IJulia Notebooks provide a flexible medium for communicating with rich text interspersed with code along with the ability to inline output (which can manifest as text, plots, images, etc.). This project aims to 1) allow creation of output that a user can interact with through GUI elements such as sliders, drop downs, text fields, and in general, user generated browser events. 2) allow kernel features to actively update output, making possible widgets such as progress bars and real-time plots.
