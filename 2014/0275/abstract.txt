Astropy is a Python library for astronomy and astrophysics. One of its
affiliated packages is astroquery. Astroquery offers APIs to web services
to query astronomical data.

The major plan is to add support for more services to the astroquery package. I will also fix astroquery issues to improve the stability and to extend existing web service interfaces.
