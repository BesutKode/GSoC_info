This project will implement a "multiple imputation using chained equations" routine into the statsmodels Python package. This will allow researchers who use Python to have a more sophisticated treatment of missing data than the current complete case analysis treatment. In particular, scientists in the social and biomedical sciences can make better inferences with any model choice, per unit of costly data.
