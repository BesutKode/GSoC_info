obfsproxy is a python framework for obsfuscating traffic between a client and a server. obfsproxy was initially designed and currently used with Tor software as a tool to obfuscate Tor traffic and bypass censorship tools. obfsproxy supports multiple protocols which specify how the underlying traffic will be transformed, these are called pluggable transports. Apart from using obfsproxy with Tor, it can be used to camouflage other types of traffic such as VPN or SSH connections.
