Many of online tracking algorithms are subject to two kinds of problems: the inability to manage variation of targetâ€™s scale during a video sequence and the selection of positive and negative samples in the training of the classifiers.  I'd like to address such problems developing a saliency-based target scale detection and cooperative samples selection and create more suitable salience algorithms in the context of tracking, thus giving greater prominence to the feature of motion.
