Scikit-learn is a an open source machine learning library that gives users access to cutting edge implementations of data classifying techniques. Data set size growth mean memory limitations are encountered more frequently. Improvements will be made to support sparse input and output formats to help make larger data sets and multiclass methods more feasible to work with when using large amounts of sparse data.
