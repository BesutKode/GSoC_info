The goal of this project is to implement an HTML5+Javascript replacement for screencasting and integrate it with a composition tool. The end result of this project will allow non-specialists to author an HTML5+Javascript slideshow using something like Thimble, add a voiceover, and create something that plays back in the browser (so that search engines and accessibility aids can "see" the content) with a fraction of the data download required by video.
