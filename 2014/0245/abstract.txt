A recently launched web-based extension of the Gambit project, Game Theory Explorer (GTE), aims to provide a lightweight yet powerful tool for game theory. Given that GTE is still in development, it is missing several key features, namely the ability to represent and solve games with more than two players. Accordingly, we focus on extending the interface of Game Theory Explorer to allow for more than two players as well as researching and implementing algorithms for solving general-player games.
