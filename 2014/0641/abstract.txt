My proposal is to implement the following ticket:
https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/summer-of-code/ticket/1617
The purpose is to have highly performant, library quality concurrent datastructures for haskell.
These are to be implemented without locking using atomic operations.

Specifically I want to implement an Hash Map.
Probably: Lock free hash Table by Cliff Click
