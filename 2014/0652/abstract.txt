The project aims at enhancing CommCare module to improve integration with Task module by providing an intuitive UI to select actual CommCare form/case fields by means of field name.

The project also strives to support multiple versions of forms provided by CommCare. A typical use case is when old forms are not synced with the latest versions of form. 

Project will also allow the capability to connect to multiple CommCareHQ servers and retrieve form/cases from all of the connected servers.
