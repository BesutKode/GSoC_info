OWASP PHPSEC is an effort by a group of developers in securing PHP web applications, using a collection of decoupled flexible secure PHP libraries, as well as a collection of PHP tools. On top of a collection of libraries and tools, PHPSEC contains a sample framework to demonstrate proper usage of the tools and libraries. It can also be easily merged with existing PHP code, because it is both decoupled and flexible. Proper usage of PHPSEC will result in the target system being much more secure.
