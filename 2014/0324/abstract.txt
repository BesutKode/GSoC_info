GRASS GIS' capabilities of representing and processing data in 3D raster (voxel) format, are rare among other GIS software packages and open opportunities for new applications, especially in research. In this project I would like to extend the 3D raster handling capabilities by developing a module for computing 3D vector flow lines of a voxel representing trivariate continuous field. This new module, r3.flow, will extend the functionality of module r.flow into the third dimension.
