Astronomical surveys like SDSS and The Dark Energy survey have provided enough image information for astronomers to perform source detection of celestial bodies by applying various data mining techniques. In this project we aim to develop an Image based Bayesian model fitting technique to detect and characterize astronomical sources in an image. Using Bayesian Inference, We are going to find best possible functional representations for the sources within single band images in the sky.
