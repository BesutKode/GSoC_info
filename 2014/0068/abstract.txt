Zotonicâ€™s approach to web development and the choice of Erlang is interesting. The field of web frameworks is very competitive and despite all the features Zotonic has, some websites have a large number of simultaneous users and must be resilient against failures. A way to solve this problem is distribute the content of websites across multiple servers and data centers. This project provides the development of the building blocks needed to improve fault tolerance, performance and data locality.
