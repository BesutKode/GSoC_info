Currently Apache Bloodhound provides a method for creating tickets by filling a form with relevant information. But as it provides the functionality just for add one ticket a time, for a user who requires to create a large number of tickets could be really tedious process. So the major idea of this project is to implement a functionality which will make it possible for the users to batch-create tickets by converting WikiFormatted tables into set of tickets.
