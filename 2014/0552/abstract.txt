Currently, SBCL does not have very good support for working with Unicode text. In order to improve SBCL's Unicode support, I propose to create a 'sb-unicode' package that will contain implementations of the algorithms used in the Unicode standard and provide other facilities for working with Unicode text. I also propose to implement a "Unicode string" type, which will allow functions in the 'cl' package to operate correctly and transparently on Unicode data.
