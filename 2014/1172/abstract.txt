I am currently a student contributing to the SPDX project at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. This proposal outlines the work I would like to continue to contribute to the SPDX Tooling project. The bulk of this project will be redesigning the FOSSology+SPDX user interface to create a more user oriented system, and improving the performance of the FOSSology source code scanner within the FOSSology+SPDX suite.
