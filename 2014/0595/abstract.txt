The Map subtab Project for Sigmah is a feature aimed at obtaining a better coordination in the humanitarian sector. It will allow users to store their geographical project data in one place, preventing confusion and loss of information usually caused by the inefficient data management. It will also offer support for delivering this intelligence, along with other relevant project details, in HXL format to the Sahana cloud where other organisations can benefit from them in the blink of an eye.
