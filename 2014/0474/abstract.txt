Skeleton models have been widely used to represent the human shape, due to its simple but informative nature. One of the main applications of skeleton models corresponds to human action recognition, performed in a sequence of skeletal configurations. Ofli et al. proposed a novel and robust method to perform action recognition, which is highly intuitive and interpretable, in comparison with previous approaches. For this reason, the aim of this project is to implement the approach in (PCL).
