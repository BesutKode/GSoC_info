The goal of this project is to provide an interface to integrate FEniCS, an FE library, into Octave. This will improve Octave features, and also make FE software more accessible, allowing for straightforward visualisation capabilities and the exploitation of Octave utilities, solvers, etc. It will not start from scratch, but build on the work done during the previous GSoC to further optimise the code and provide other functionalities not yet available in the Octave Forge package, fem-fenics.
