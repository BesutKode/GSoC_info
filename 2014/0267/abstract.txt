Several aspects of OMPL will be improved during this project, as time allows. A multi-threaded RRT* algorithm will be implemented that achieves superlinear speedup for shortest path problems. Cost-based planning will be improved by updating the T-RRT algorithm with recent advances. Experienced-based planning will be added to OMPL to reduce planning time using various cutting edge methods including sampling from constraint manifolds.
