The goal of this project is to analyze the different strategies to successfully incorporate the numeric library Spire into Breeze and to provide an implementation of the suggested design. The interoperability will allow Breeze to take advantage of Spire's rich hierarchy of mathematical abstractions and their efficient implementations. The resulting library will be showcased by solving a specific numerical problem in Astrophysics which requires an efficient implementation of numerical procedures.
