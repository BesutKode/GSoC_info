There are a few ways to do process orchestration in PyWPS, but experience showed us that they are complicated or have problems like dealing with large datasets. So I propose the idea to expand the capabilities of PyWPS so it is possible to describe the orchestration workflow in a simple xml document which is parsed and executed by a PyWPS process. This orchestration process will support if/else conditions, loops and the retrieval of results from a running process.
