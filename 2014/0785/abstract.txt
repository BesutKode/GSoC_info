Memory tracing tools has higher overhead due to the instrumentation code around actual code which might use temporary registers. In such cases instrumented code save and restore the temporary registers. If we run 32-bit applications in 64-bit mode we can use extra registers in 64-bit mode which do not exists for 32-bit machine as temporary register which will definitely improve performance.
