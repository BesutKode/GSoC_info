In the context of computational systems biology, a question is how to identify parameters of a CTMC so that the model fits with actual biological experiments, for the particular parameter values cannot be usually inferred from the experimental data only. A related problem is the exploration of parameter values with respect to changes in the system dynamics.

The aim of the project is to implement techniques of this kind and enhancements thereof as part of the PRISM model checker.
