Current module is implemented in Fortran 77 which is not quite popular these days and has its own limitations.
It has some limitations like use of too many global variables(whose significance is hard to understand for a new developer), lack of code re-usability etc.
So Aim of this project is to develop and test a particle tracking API having the power of parallel computing and use standard easy to use and understand naming conventions and refactoring 
of existing module using this API.
