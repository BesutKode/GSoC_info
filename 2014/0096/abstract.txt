Plotting Astronomical images is an essential part of research in Astronomy and this project is designed to develop a new framework to plot Astronomical images in world coordinate systems (WCS). Although there are packages capable of plotting Astronomical images such as APLpy, we want to develop a package that can be completely integrated with Astropy. A basic implementation of the new framework, WCSAxes already works but a lot more work still needs to be done on this before it can be released.
