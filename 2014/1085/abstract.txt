Tianocore provides an open source implementation of the UEFI specification. It supplies a firmware development environment, EDK2, which consists of packages and build tools for developing UEFI-compatible applications. This project aims at porting the Tianocore implementation for the BeagleBoneBlack embedded board, serving as a guide for other developers who wish to port UEFI to their own hardware.
