I would like to work in a framework that provides the basis for the further development of a Website Fingerprinting countermeasure. Despite the relevance of website fingerprinting attacks and the existence of some possible countermeasures, there is no implementation in Tor yet. The goal would be to prototype a countermeasure in a Pluggable Transport that would provide the primitives for the development of more sophisticated protocols.
