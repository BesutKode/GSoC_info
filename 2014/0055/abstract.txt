Caja, the file manager for MATE, has a library that allows developers to extend its functionality. Extensions are loaded when Caja starts, and cannot be activated during runtime. The necessity to either restart Caja is inconvenient and can be confusing to new users. The goal of this project is to improve Caja to allow integration of extensions during runtime. This requires Caja to keep track of available extensions, and will also allow extension configuration from a singular user interface.
