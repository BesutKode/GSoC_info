The aim of this project is to improve the stability and to make Boxes even more time saving as it is now. In order to achieve this I plan to widen the spectrum of supported operating systems/distributions for the express installation. Furthermore I will add an ISO downloading functionality which allows the user to provide the data needed for express installation before the download completes. This project also includes a hardening sprint for Boxes.
