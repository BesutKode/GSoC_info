OpenEngSB provides an easy-to-use and easy-to-adapt platform for tool integration. One important issue for further implementation is to evaluate the currently available ontology data storage, to choose the best one available, and implement the backend within the OpenEngSB. The aim of this project is to solve this issue and implement the chosen storage within the OpenEngSB platform with capability of instance versioning and model evolution.
