Ecological niche modeling technique has gained popularity in estimating species distributions. Package ‘dismo’ in R has implemented various niche modeling algorithms. However, processing of input and output data are done outside R, especially in ArcGIS. Package ENMGadgets facilitates users to prepare data required for niche models in R environments with few functions like DistanceFilter, PCARaster, PCAProjection, etc. We are proposing to strengthen ENMGadgets by providing few more functions.
