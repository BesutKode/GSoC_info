I plan to improve the Haskell Database Connectivity (HDBC) libraries, in particular to optimise and resolve some issues in the HDBC-ODBC driver. Iâ€™m aiming to improve the efficiency of the library and resolve some outstanding issues. In order to validate my results, I also plan to provide a more comprehensive testing and benchmarking suite to compare the various database drivers. This itself is an important contribution to the library as it would help others who work on these libraries.
