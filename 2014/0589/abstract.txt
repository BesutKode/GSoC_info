A rewrite
of the codebase to use a higher level language and framework will make
it more maintainable, cut down on development time, and attract more
developers. Also, a move towards a graph database or the use of graph
algorithms on top of a relational database will greatly reduce server
load and enhance page response time. Finally, an API will greatly reduce
the complexity of interacting with the website.
