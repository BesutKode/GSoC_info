In order to prepare for an on-campus event, the organizer picks out a set of small bugs of an appropriate difficulty for the audience. Currently, these bugs are handpicked by querying the web interface and copying bugs into a spreadsheet: a very labor-intensive process. My project adds a UI and back-end support to the OpenHatch website for generating a "bite-size" bug set by pulling data from our bug DB, allowing for user customization, storage and sharing of the set.
