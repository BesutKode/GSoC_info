Mozilla needs to fill the gap between B2G and other mobile OSes, and also desktop Firefox lacks this important feature already available at Google Chrome. In addition, weâ€™ll have a new 	Web API empowering developers , and every speech recognition application already developed and running on Chrome, will start to work on Firefox without changes. On future, this can be 	integrated on other Mozilla products, opening windows to a whole new class of interactive applications.
