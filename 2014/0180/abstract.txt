This project aims to improve the R Interactive Graphics via HTml (RIGHT) package that enables interactive data visualization and analysis to explore data and gain valuable insight. We plan to improve RIGHT in two ways. One is to execute R code for analysis on a server, overlay the results and update them interactively in response to hiding data.The other is to support ggplot2-like R API to create complex visualization more easily.
