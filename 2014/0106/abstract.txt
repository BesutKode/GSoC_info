OpenCL Module for PCL is one of the attempts to increase the user productivity by increasing real time performance of algorithms. Over the years, computers/machines are expected to perform fast for computationally intensive application need. Use of Many-Core (GPU, MIC) and multi core CPU can satisfy high performance need of scientific and engineering applications. By using OpenCL, we can run PCL algorithms on heterogeneous platforms and can achieve higher throughput.
