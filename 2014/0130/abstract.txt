GNU LibffCall Code is written in C & assembly language and there is no technical documentation regarding it, which makes extremely difficult to understand the code. As there is assembly code for different platforms so there is use of different instruction sets, opcodeâ€™s and labels which make it a programmer's nightmare. So there is an immediate need of refactoring the code for helping programmers to understand  the code for future reference.
