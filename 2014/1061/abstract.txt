This project will expose the more advanced features of the ViennaCL API, and add support for multiple devices on different compute back-ends. Furthermore, when combined with PyOpenCL and PyCUDA, Python is the ideal language for the rapid development of GPGPU algorithms. Thus, after this project, PyViennaCL will support the prototyping of GPGPU algorithms involving ViennaCL objects, which will be useful not only for ViennaCL's users, but ultimately ViennaCL itself.
