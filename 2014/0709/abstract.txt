The purpose of this project is to develop a stand-alone graphical user interface for the ViennaCL benchmark. The GUI will allow its users to run ViennaCL benchmarks and examine the results in an intuitive and easy to use way. In addition, the GUI will help ViennaCL gather valuable performance data across different types of hardware by providing the users with an option to upload their benchmark results.
