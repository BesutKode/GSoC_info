This project will add VGA Capture feature using VGA capture expansion board for HDMI2USB on Digilent Atlys Hardware. VGA interface is still most common, hence it will provide greater reach to HDMI2USB project. This project envisages adding an expansion board along with associated HDL, with least modification to current HDMI2USB core while using most present components like JPEG encoder, buffers and UVC USB components.
