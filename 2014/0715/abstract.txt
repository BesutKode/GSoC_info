This project will improve the web user interface of debci, add multi-arch and suite support, and provide more useful information for package maintainers (failing dependencies, etc.). The web user interface will also provide searching of tested packages by architecture (ARM, i386, amd64) and suite (Debian stable, unstable, testing). This would help package maintainers understand what is causing a package to fail testing and would help to improve the quality of Debian packages.
