Great advances in materials science and engineering are attributed to supercomputers and their ability to predict materials properties prior to synthesis. Existing scientific literature search engines are restricted since they only allow searches by keywords. The proposed project offers the user the ability to search the existing literature for starting chemicals (precursors), anticipated materials (products), temperatures, machines and other conditions.
