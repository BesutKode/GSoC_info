The analyzer can model domain-specific information that it can exploit to find bugs. One way is to use the BodyFarm, which allows the analyzer to synthesize faux implementations to better model the semantics of code. The analyzer lacks domain-specific knowledge of important APIs. This project would extend BodyFarm to make it easier to write models for APIs. This would lay foundation work for global analysis by providing a way to represent models that could be auto synthesized.
