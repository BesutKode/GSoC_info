The main goal of this project is to develop a new OpenMRS module to supply information on system performance and utilization in order to monitor reliability and impact of the electronic medical record system installation.  This module would monitor OpenMRS and transfer specific system indicators. These indicators include both low level system indicators (CPU load, memory utilization, etc.) as well as application level indicators (# logins per day per user, # of opened charts, etc.).
