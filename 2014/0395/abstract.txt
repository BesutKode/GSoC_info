For a long period of time Graphite was relying on CLooG to produce GIMPLE code. The Integer Set Library (ISL) recently became available in this project to be used as a back end of CLooG. ISL is nowadays mature enough to replace CLooG with own code generation that sometimes is better. This project aims to integrate ISL code generation into Graphite and avoid necessity of CLooG in GCC.
