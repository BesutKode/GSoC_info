Currently in WSO2 ESB, the only possible way of debugging the message flow is to put log mediators in the sequence flow. ( Even though the remote debugging is there which is based on JVM runtime but here focus is on Synapse configuration based debugging which is also known as mediation debugging. ) This project is about how standard debugging capabilities be adapted to the Synapse configuration based mediation flow and integrate those capabilities to WSO2 ESB.
