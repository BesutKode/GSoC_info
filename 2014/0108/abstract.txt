The Dense Tracking and Mapping (DTAM) algorithm, allows realtime camera pose tracking and dense 3D reconstruction using only video from a camera. DTAM is a variational algorithm that is a major advance in both detail and robustness over the current common algorithms such as PTAM, and does not require feature tracking. DTAM has applications in augmented reality, robotics, and 3D scanning.
