ExpEYES ( Experiments for Young Engineers and Scientists) is an Open Hardware and Free Software framework for developing science experiments and classroom demonstrations. 
This project will work on developing a  set of plug-ins  for ExpEYES.  These plug-ins with GUI's will enhance the scope of ExpEYES for using it to perform several experiments in mechanics, sound  and waves.   
Project will also focus on adding features for using acoustic and motion sensors for various science experiments.
