The goal of the abbreviation base project is deriving a dictionary from DBpedia. The project involves extraction of as many abbreviations as possible from as many DBpedia datasets (in different languages) as possible. They are to be aggregated and published in Linked Open Data knowledge base using Lemon Model. The knowledge base will be interlinked with DBpedia, queryable via SPARQL. The project is based on Semantic Web Technology. It is an effective application of DBpedia and Linked Open Data.
