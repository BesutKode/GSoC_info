Project aims to improve the user interactivity with Wikidata and create a whole new world of data sharing and saving by creating a tool that on highlighting a statement would provide a GUI to fix its structure then feed it to Wikidata.  Wikidata centralizes access to and structurally manage data so that every piece of data is easily available and accessible. By the means of the plugin people can save their important notes and quotes directly on Wikidata hence making it more accessible.
