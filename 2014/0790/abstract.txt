Electronic medical records are an important tool for improving and monitoring patient care. The usefulness of EMR systems relies on understanding the accuracy of the underlying data. Unfortunately, quantifying EMR accuracy is inconsistent across EMR systems. This proposal outlines the development of software to quantify EMR accuracy using consistent and best practices identified from academic literature and to report back on data quality to assist in quality improvement in OpenMRS deployments.
