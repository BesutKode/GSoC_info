The aim of this project is to enhance the functionality and usage of sprites thereby improving game creation in Scala using Kojo.
1)Sprite Collision Detection: A feature to detect collision among sprites to improve game and animation development in Kojo. This makes use of Image edge detection.
3)Physics Integration: Using JBox2D to integrate physics realism into game development.
2)Developing a 2D platform game based in Kojo to showcase and thoroughly try and test the functionality.
