Currently there are very few functions implemented in CSymPy. I aim to extend the module of the elementary functions further, on the similar lines of SymPy . I expect to implement a certain subset of special functions which are already implemented in SymPy. Since CSymPy is particularly new, almost all the special functions have certain dependencies. The project aims in developing a modular architecture to first implement the dependencies and then develop the special functions
