I am interested in topics related to positioning and satellites orbit prediction and I would like to participate in the project Distributed Ground Station Network. I am currently working on numerical methods to predict orbit of satellites of good known GPS. There are systems and many available applications used to positioning and navigation on the Earth. The idea of positioning objects in the space sounds more challenging.
