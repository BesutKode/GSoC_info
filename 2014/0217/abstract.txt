As an extension to the previous project, the aim of the project is used to overlay the images spatially using different GIS tools. We are given a EM data and a thin section image and asked to reference the images.As we have a EM data(which is a high resolution image), we need to make sure that the base layer(image) can be made to geo-reference the points. So, for this to be clear we will be using jQuery for zoom levels so that the user can point-out the coordiantes more easily and accurately.
