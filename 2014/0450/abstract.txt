This project aims at adding a few extensions to the VTK library to support Geospatial and Climate based visualizations in the VTK library. 

The proposed work can be divided into 4 tasks as described below:
1) Add new features to existing filters such as neat labelling of the contours
2) New readers to read LIDAR dataset and GeoJSON geometry data into VTK
3) Improve handling of time in VTK
4) Implement tile rendering in VTK (optional - time permitting)
