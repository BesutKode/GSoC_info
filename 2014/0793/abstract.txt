I would like to work on the project "Hack a Stuffed Animal" this Summer. I have previous experience with programming with Scratch, building robots, usability design testing, and I find this project immensely interesting. I really like the idea of taking a child's stuffed animal and turning it into an input device that the child could use to learn new technology. I really like how it's focus is on children who are challenged with non-verbal skills, such as children with Autism.
