Apache Pig a platform for analyzing large scale data sets using high-level data
flow language.  Currently Pig utilizes two frameworks, JavaCC and ANTLR for
generating language processors.

In this Google Summer of Code project, I will reimplement GruntParser using
ANTLR and merge it QueryParser.  Removing GruntParser's dependency on JavaCC
will help Apache Pig project keep clean, easy to maintain codebase and continue
to be improved by many contributors.
