GDAL/OGR is widely used geospatial data abstraction library. The transformation done in the last GSoC is implemented through equation-based approach by 7-parameters transform. Other way of transforming coordinates is using grid-shift transform. However, grid-shift has only been defined to transform horizontal datum. This project will implement 3D grid shift transformation  and integrates this workflow into existing coordinate transformation chain.
