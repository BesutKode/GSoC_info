Ember is a client framework providing a dynamic 3D graphical environment. It allows to create worlds and characters, who can interact with their environment. In order to obtain a more natural rendering of the characters's movements, we propose to integrate SmartBody functionalities into Ember engine. SmartBody is an animation platform allowing the manipulation of 3D humanoid models. Concretely, it will enable Ember characters to have a more realistic and human-like behavior.
