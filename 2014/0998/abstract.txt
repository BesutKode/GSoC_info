The idea of this proposal is to give maximum productivity to developers by giving them the ability to extend the core of the Scala IDE with their own modules. Such a feature is well known by editors like Vim or Sublime Text, but more or less non-existent in the IDE world. The user defined modules should, on the one hand, be written entirely in Scala and be powerful enough to let them define the behavior of their IDE, but, on the other side, hide all the complexity of the Scala IDE internals.
