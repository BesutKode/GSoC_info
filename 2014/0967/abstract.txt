Development of a simple module based on the JGrasstools libraries to be used in uDig's Spatial Toolbox. The module will estimate the maximum fluvial corridor that can be eroded during extreme flood events.

This will be the starting point for the evaluation of the solid transportation during flooding events, in particular related to wood and sediments.
