The major goal for this project is to develop a QA (question answering) engine for DBpedia. I will introduce how to implement each module in a typical QA engine including template-generation, disambiguation, querygeneration, answergeneration, and Rendering. I will also show how to extend it for multiple languages. In the final, the project will outcome a complete QA engine for DBpedia that is able to answer a varieties of  questions in different languages.
