Pkg is the novel package management system designed for using in *BSD. Currently, pkg can work merely with binary remote repositories that are specific for an architecture and are updated by FreeBSD build cluster. My idea is to write abstract repositories layer that will be able to handle multiple source types, such as ports, pkgsrc or even software specific repositories, such as CPAN. Performance, priorities and options interaction are the subjects of investigation.
