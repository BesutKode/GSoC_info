Boost uBlas offers many different algorithms for operations on vectors and matrices. The selection of the best algorithms to use and the most efficient order of operations for a given problem is difficult and directly affects the libraries performance. This project seeks to introduce Smart Expression Templating and the compile time reorganization of expressions in order to maximize performance.
