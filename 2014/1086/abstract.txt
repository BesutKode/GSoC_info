SupportPress is an E-Mail based help desk tool that allows E-Mail based communication between between user and support team. SupportPress is heavily used mainly by WordPress theme/plugin review teams. SupportPress is developed using BackPress. Not many developers uses BackPress which makes it difficult to contribute to SupportPress as well as attract new contributors. So my project is to convert SupportPress to a plugin so as to make it easily maintainable as well as attract new contributors.
