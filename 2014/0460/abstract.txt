Parallelization is a branch of computing where multiple processes are executed simultaneously. Our research focuses on applying parallelizing FastJet, a C++ package used at CERN and other particle accelerators. Event reconstruction is computationally intensive, and further advances will require improved efficiency. By altering FastJet to run on multiple cores, we will decrease computation time. Outcomes from this research can be implemented in order to optimize jet clustering algorithms.
