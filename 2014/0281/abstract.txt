Tahrir aims to be a distributed, decentralized, scalable, and anonymous "work alike" for currently present social networking site services. During the course of summer I intend to create a single API access for the non GUI part of the code-base to make it easy for one to implement various GUI models. Also to carry out bug fixes for the entire project to help Tahrir reach its initial release.
