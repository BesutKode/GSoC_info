MQTT-SN is equivalent to the HTTP in the Internet of Things. It is an open communication standard between devices that communicate with each other without human interaction. It is estimated that in 2020 fifteen billion of such devices will work over the world. MQTT-SN is suitable for constrained environments which consist of low-power devices with limited processing capabilities. This is a project which aim is to provide generic implementation of MQTT-SN protocol for 802.15.4 in Wiselib.
