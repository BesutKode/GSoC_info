PDE X development had begun under GSoC 2013 as a first step towards building a new and advanced code editor for Processing. For GSoC 2014, I’d like to continue my work on PDE X, adding some more features like on the fly documentation support, code-folding, tooltip hints, code snippets and more. I’ll also be polishing it further with bug fixes and internal optimizations to make PDE X stable and ready to form the basis of the next version of Processing.
