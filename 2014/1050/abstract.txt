Managing date and time is not simple and many of us, developers, don't like to do it.
Unfortunatelly we need this in almost any application. To be honest, I can't imagine an
application that does not use date or time in some point.
The goal of this project is to make it more simple and more intuitive. The result would be
writing less code by developers.
