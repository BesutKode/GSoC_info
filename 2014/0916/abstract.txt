This project aims at the development of a generic picture-dictionary kind of Ruby on Rails web application specifically for all of their volunteer sites (eg. Micronesia) to help in development of local languages which have no written script (eg. Chuukese). This application would work offline through which volunteers & contributors could upload photos taken around town even where internet access is scarce and add local language (eg. Chuukese) phonetic text and English translation.
