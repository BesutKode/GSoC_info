This is a GSoC 2014 project proposal to the Institute of Artificial Intelligence at the University Bremen. The main topic addresses the project idea "Reasoning 3D CAD models of objects". The proposal presents my statement of motivation, my software development skill set and my educational background that recommend me for the project. Moreover, it includes a tentative high level implementation plan given the discussions I have had with the mentor, Moritz Tenorth.
