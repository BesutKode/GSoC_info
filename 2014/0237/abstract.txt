The overarching goal of this project is to extend INCF Scalable Brain Atlas with a service in which a user can select an online atlas, upload a brain scan, and see the regions of the atlas projected on the scan. Two main ingredients for achieving this are (1) Image registration and, (2) Bitmap to vector tracing. Many good implementations for image registration exist, but for vector tracing the main candidates (AutoTrace, PoTrace) have severe shortcomings stated in the proposal with the solution.
