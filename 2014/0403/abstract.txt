QEMU's vmstates (device states) play an important role in setting up the virtual infrastructure for a virtual machine. Currently, there does not exist any functionality to find errors or missing substates of a device state. Thus, the goal of this project is to implement a randomized save/reset/load device state test. This will help the community in resolving bugs related to the vmstate when they either add a new vmstate / sub vmstate or add new properties to the existing vmstates.
