Implementing a data-centric approach to provenance capture in Sumatra, usability and interoperability of the reproducible research tool are enhanced. Establishing infrastructure for data-process associations in the first part of this project will enable the addition of data-centric views to the software's interfaces in the second part, providing a new and important mode of sharing, reproducing and interacting with computational results with Sumatra.
