D3.js is an interactive plotting tool and is widely used for generating visualization embedded in websites. We already have Plotrb for building charts via D3.js, but current Plotrb can only generate static charts. The goal of my project is to build interactive visualization, and still allows fast prototyping, customizability, and integration to other SciRuby components. My plan is inspired by Bokeh.
