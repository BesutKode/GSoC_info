DHIS2 provides a lot of facilities for collecting and analyzing data. In GSoC 2013, my goal was to implement basic reporting tool, which enabled users to aggregate reports and create anonymous events. In this project, my aim will be to utilize other facilities of DHIS2 Web API. I want to bring to current dhis2 android client such features as support of messaging among DHIS2 users, standard dashboard, interpretations and finally complete tracking functionality.
