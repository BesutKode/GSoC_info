GNU Radio as a digital signal processing program requires numerous mathematical operations to be executed readily and repeatedly. A faster way to process signals allows projects with high timing constraints such as channel sounding. Past co-processor projects including GPUs, FPGAs, and DSPs do not scale well with new devices. This summer we would like to implement a purely open source three step approach [1] that would improve the state of GNU Radio co-processing for years to come.
