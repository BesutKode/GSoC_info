VM save/restore functionality is one of the most commonly used in Clouds and
Virtualization platforms. The current implementation of VM save/restore in Xen
results in loading the entire memory image of the VM from the save file which in
turns slows down the entire process. I plan to improve this process by introducing
the concept of Lazy restore and using memory paging.
