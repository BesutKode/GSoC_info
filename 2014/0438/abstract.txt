The present stable release of Bugzilla uses YUI2 library for its user interface which is now deprecated and is no longer maintained . There is a compelling need to migrate to the latest version of YUI that is YUI3 as it is a more secure and an actively maintained framework . Therefore in this application , I propose to perform the task of complete migration of the Bugzilla codebase from YUI2 to YUI3 and subsequently carry on the task of refactoring the code.
