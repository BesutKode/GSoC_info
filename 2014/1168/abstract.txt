zoomin hao from china. Graduate student of CAS. 
  Now work in a team about 3D Urban Scene Modeling and street view.
  And happy and excited to return to LG project after 2012 participation (Liquid Galaxy synchronization with Javascript).My major is computer graphics. 
  I'd be eager to cooperate with you guys again and propose the idea about intergrating chinese street view into "peruse-a-sue" sys.
