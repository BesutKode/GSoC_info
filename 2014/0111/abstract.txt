MediaWiki can be enhanced with additional functionality by adding extensions. There are currently about 2000 extensions available on MediaWiki.org. However, it is hard to identify and assess which extension fits a particular need. The aim of this project is to address this situation by adding functionality such as a rating review system, data syndication and collection to enhance Wikiapiary.org, which maintains structured data of all the extensions correctly.
