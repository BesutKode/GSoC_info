The core idea is to build a PathVisio plugin that connects to Expression Atlas in order to directly load data sets and visualize the data on pathways in PathVisio. Next focus is a plugin on human tissue data available from Expression Atlas in order to determine which pathways are active in which tissues or have different levels of activity between certain tissues. As a final step in the project, the 'tissue' plugin is used to determine the ‘tissue-profile’ for each pathway on WikiPathways.
