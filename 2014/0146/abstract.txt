When a user records his/her own voice through a microphone invariably there is noise in the recorded audio and it becomes harder to analyze how well the user is faring with regards to improving pronunciation.
So the aim of this project is to have a noise filter implemented within Artikulate and also a way of visually representing user's performance.
