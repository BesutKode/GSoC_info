This is a proposal for the improvement and expansion of the work done during the last GSoC edition in scene text detection. The main goals are: implementing a text grouping algorithm combining the multiple segmentations provided by the current implementation, and adding a character recognition (OCR) module. At the same time, an optimization task is also proposed, in order to make the detection algorithm implemented last year as fast as possible.
