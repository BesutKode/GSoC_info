Reference Application is a state of the art implementation of OpenMRS, which may serve as a solid base for new implementations. However, lots of the administrative tasks e.g concept, form, global property, roles, locations and privilege management are still being done from the legacy user interface which is accessed via the Advanced Administration App, these tasks need to be ported to the reference application too.
