Package bdvis is already under development and was part of GSoC 2013. Right now the package has basic functionality to perform biodiversity data visualizations, but with growing user base for the package, requests for features are coming up. We propose to add the user requested functionality and implement some new visualization  functions to take bdvis to next level. We also plan to prepare a detailed vignette and submit the package to CRAN.
