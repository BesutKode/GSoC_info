Being a student from developing country, I  really appreciated what you have done, and I'm deeply attracted by your ideas.
Also, I believe, I'm a self-motivated person as you need.
As the project, I want to do the node.js project "OpenMRS ID Platform Improvements" with mentor Elliott Williams.
Please get me involved.
