This project would involve updating the current RouteFlow application on top of an OpenFlow 1.3 capable controller (e.g., Ryu and OpenDaylight) and develop the required code changes to use the 1.3 APIs. Furthermore, the project should explore how to get use of newly introduced features in OpenFlow 1.x, such as IPv6, multiple-table support, group tables, TTL-decrement actions, and QoS flow metering options.
