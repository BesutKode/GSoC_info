The aim of this project is to improve the Cling user prompt to provide hints about the location of unknown names in the code.  
The suggestion will prompt the user to load a particular missing header (and library, when applicable) where the name is to be found.  
If there is no ambiguity, the user may choose an option to automatically load the required files and evaluate the previous input again.
