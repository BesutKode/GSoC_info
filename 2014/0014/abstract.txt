This proposal focuses on extending support for approximate inference in current structured output framework in Shogun: 
1) Implementing large-scale multi-label classification algorithms such as online structured learning and multi-label prediction using feature hashing.
2) Implementing the calibrated label ranking for large- scale multi-label structured output learning problems.
