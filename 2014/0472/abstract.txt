Hey Tox devs, I'm 'red' from IRC! My goals in working with the Tox Project over the Summer would be to assist naxuroqa in bringing A/V to the Venom client. I have already started helping him in my spare time between classes, providing some webcam and microphone capture code. I'm confident that we will have A/V support in Venom well before the end of the Summer. After that, I can help wherever is needed. I have already talked to mannol about helping with congestion control in toxcore.
