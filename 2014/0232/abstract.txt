I am planning the following converter extensions:
As Scratch projects are generally in the landscape format, while with mobile phones a portrait mode is encouraged, currently half of the screen is unused with converted Scratch projects.
Further Scratch features I am planning to implement are variables and formula elements. Supporting those would greatly increase the number of Scratch projects suitable for converting.
The priority of other open Scratch features is best discussed in the team.
