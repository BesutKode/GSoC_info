Object segmentation is a prominent computer vision problem, and with the advent of RGBD sensors like Kinect this problem is solved much better than just using the color information.The objective is to develop framework, by integrating existing methods to do effective RGB-D object segmentation in clutter indoor environments. Overall approach is to divide the scene into segments and then group them to form an object using machine learning techniques.
