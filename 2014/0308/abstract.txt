This project will improve integration between the OWTF and external tools such as ZAP. 

This will be accomplished by adding the features such as Sending HTTP requests/Zest scripts from OWTF to third party tools.

Zest scripts will provide an automated mechanism to replicate exploitation of security vulnerabilities in a format that facilitates information exchange between external tools which can reproduce the same vulnerabilities in their own environment.
