Currently, the examples gallery is a static collection of code snippets and output images. We'd like users to be able to modify the code there and see the result. The outcome of this project would be a web-app that launches a sandboxed, resource-controlled Python environment (probably built on top of Docker) that executes code snippets and provides the resulting image as a response.
