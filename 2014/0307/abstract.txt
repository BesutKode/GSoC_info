I propose to improve the HTML5 drawterm I worked on last summer to
make it a production-quality terminal for Plan 9, and to separate out
its 9p library to make it available to other applications.  This will
involve cleaning up the existing code to fix display and input issues,
and implementing cpu(1)'s protocol to allow for authentication.
