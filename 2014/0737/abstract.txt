WeBWorK is an open-source online homework system for math and sciences courses. The WeBWorK Open Problem Library (OPL) is a collection of 25000 problems. Each problem is coded in a perl derived language. I noticed that partial differential equations and Biomathematics are missing on the OPL. Nowadays Biology has turned more quantitative. I believe that math problems with real data must be available as free software for teachers and students around the world.
