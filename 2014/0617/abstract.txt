The Pickup and Delivery Problem with Time windows requires that a group of vehicles satisfy a set collection of customer requests and it is a well researched problem. Each customer requires the use of single vehicle both to load a specified amount of goods at one location and to deliver them to another location. All requests must be performed without violating the vehicle capacity or the customer time window. I want to implement a Reactive-Tabu-Search to solve this problem.
