Lil' Debi provides the power of Debian on the Android Phone, it allows a user to setup Debian chroot container. The key missing part of the project is to Integrate the effective booting of Debian and Android, after which Debian can start the process/services required by Android  and they will work together. There are other features which need to be implemented like support for yaffs2, installing under /data partition, creating Debian using debootstrap, support for Ubuntu, etc.
