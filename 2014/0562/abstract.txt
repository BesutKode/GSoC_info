The new Hackage offers many novel features: package candidates, custom documentation, build reports, even a rudimentary tag system. However, often these are not used to their full potential â€“ they are either difficult to use, not exposed in the interface, have outstanding bugs, or some combination of the three.

This project aims to finish these features, so they are stable and useful to the community.
