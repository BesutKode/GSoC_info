KDevelop's C++ language support is currently built upon a custom parser living in the KDevelop repositories. The codebase for this parser is huge, it consists about 50 000 LOC. Maintaining this bulk of code requires a lot of experience which only a few people possess. This won't really change in the future, so we try to get rid off this maintenance burden by integrating Clang, which does the heavy-lifting for us.
