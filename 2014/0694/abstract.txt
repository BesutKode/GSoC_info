Vispy currently offers a Pythonic interface to OpenGL, gloo, which requires the knowledge of OpenGL and shaders. The next step towards achieving Vispy's primary goal, ie independence from OpenGL for the end-users, is the visuals layer. The visuals layer provides an abstraction layer over gloo and lets you create visual objects on the scene with a Pythonic interface. The objective of this proposal is to implement priority visuals and related functionality via the visuals architecture.
