When using virtualization, the ability to manage disk space is critical. One of the key components for achieving this is thin provisioning. However, once storage space has been allocated it is difficult to reclaim it after the virtual machine has no more need for it (e.g. user has deleted files). This project is about integrating oVirt with a utility called virt-sparsify that is able to reclaim such space and free up valuable resources.
