My proposal is to create Telegram Network connection manager and to make it work with KDE Telepathy.
I think that it's important to have safe IM service and Telegram looks like such one, so, I want to make it available for as many people as I can.
I believe in power of FOSS principles and I'm delighted with Telepathy, that's why I have no doubt about how to do it.
