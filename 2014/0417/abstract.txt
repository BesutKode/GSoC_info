This project aims to port RTEMS for OpenRISC architecture. Porting a famous open source RTOS software like RTEMS for a big open source hardware architecture such as OpenRISC would be of useful to both hw and sw communities. The new port would target a broad range of users and fields (hobbyists, digital designers, computer architecture, embedded systems, industrial applications, etc).
