CiviCRM has a lot of information about its constituents as well as their activities and contribution to the organisation. Even after this much of information and tracking, one very big problem a lot of organisation face is the lack of decision making abilities. This is mainly because there is no clear overview provided by this data. I believe that visualization of big data actually helps in clarifying the inferences out of it and at the same time gives a better and more useful overview.
