GeoTrellis uses GeoTools to read their GeoTiff data. GeoTrellis can write GeoTiff data natively. The GeoTools dependency is quite large according to the maintainers of GeoTrellis and rather slow as well. GeoTrellis reads it's own file format, ARG (Azavea Raster Graphics) files, much faster than GeoTools reads GeoTiff files. Instead of using GeoTools, GeoTrellis has put it up on Google Summer of Code 2014 to address this issue with a new, fast, Scala module for reading GeoTiff data.
