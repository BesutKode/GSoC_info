This proposal deals with extending the existing module for propositional logic and creating a new module for First Order Logic (FoL). The extension to the propositional module is in the form of faster and more memory efficient algorithms and making the module ready for use by the assumption system. Currently, there exists no support for FoL in SymPy. My idea is to lay down a basic architecture for the same and implement all its essential algorithms and move towards an inference system.
