SunPy provides routines for handling the representation and various transformations of solar coordinate information - with coordinate systems such as the Heliographic and Heliocentric. However, the Astropy API, and astropy.coordinates in particular, provides an opportunity to re-use already existing code which is efficient by design, as per APE5. My job would be to utilize Astropy's API in the reimplementation of the sunpy.wcs package.
