Apache Hadoop is one of the major systems in the Big Data age. Therefore, it is important that other systems are able to interface with it. Stratosphere, a high-performance Big Data Analytics Platform utlising abstractions from Java and Scala has a notable reputation in the field. This proposal is about making this interfacing of Stratosphere and Hadoop a reality in a very transparent way to the user for the benefits of Stratosphere and all Big Data enthusiasts in the world.
