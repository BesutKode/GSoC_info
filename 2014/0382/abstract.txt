The goal of this project will be to inject more data sources into the existing app as well as provide smoother user experience using latest Android design including fragments, actionbar, navigation drawer, pull to refresh and widgets. It will include improving the interfacing with the injectable applications to make sharing easier as well as make reading of received content easier.
