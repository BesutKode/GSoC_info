Cling is an interactive C++ interpreter based on Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. ï»¿It serves as a core component of the ROOT system for storing and analyzing the data of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments. This project implements scripts to extend the capabilities of the continuous integration server used to produce nightly builds of Cling for a wide range of platforms. The scripts are also targeted to be independent of the current CI services powered by Electric Commander.
