The OSL hosts a 3 node ftp mirroring cluster serving terabytes of open source data. In the currently deployed code the configuration is distributed across bash scripts, config files and crontab entries which becomes very difficult to manage. The goal of my project is to develop a better master/slave syncing architecure, build a REST API that runs on master/slave node, a basic CLI and depending on feasibility, extended CLI and web dashboard for syncing analytics.
