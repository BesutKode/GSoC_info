Keeping Medical Records in an electronic form than in huge traditional paper charts/files on patients is exactly what EMRS does, therefore the ability  to retrieve data is a "must have", thus a very vital and argent need to incorporate rapid perusal of patient data into our OpenMRS EMR.Here my goal is to build a GOOD Chart Search module for our new OpenMRS Ref App as a tool to achieve the above aim using some available open source resources plus my own robust inventions.
