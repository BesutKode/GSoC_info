This project aims at coming up with a mechanism enabling SWB to automatically calibrate the spectrometer(s) of the users & the Macros module which will  enable the users to write their own macros to automate their routine works on SWB. The second part of this project is an offline version of SWB. With these features on board, the SWB will be much more user friendly and effective too.
