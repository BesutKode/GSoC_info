This project aims to provide a fully functional and well documented Cinematic Editor for jME3. It would enable jME3  game developers to  visually track and manipulate all the cinematic events(Motion/Sound/Gui/Animation) involved in a cinematic/cutscene clip. The editor will provide cool additional tools that would make the process of creating in-game cutscenes/intros/trailers a delight.
