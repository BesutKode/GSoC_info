Due to the incoming ESA Sentinel satellite missions, huge time series data will be widely and freely available; new image GUIs need to be added in order to manage efficiently all derived layers in Monteverdi2. The goal of this project is to add new OTB Monteverdi2 functionalities for Satellite Image Time Series visualization, based on ICE and OpenGL APIs. In particular, ‘cover flow’ visualization modes and ‘criteria ordering’ could be useful tools for a dynamic and efficient data managing.
