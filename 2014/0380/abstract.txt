As part of building a Web of trust in the unsecured world of the Internet, users and developers need to utilize public and private key pairs. These unique key pairs give users the ability to sign and encrypt data in an authenticated and secure way. Public keys are typically stored in certificate objects. This project seeks to develop a module for PicketLink database/LDAP storage by implementing management of Certificates through CRUD operations by exploiting Bouncy Castle cryptography API.
