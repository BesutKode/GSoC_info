A garbage collector is an important piece of today virtual machines but sometimes it introduces some significant overhead. One way to reduce this problem is to utilize a parallel approach during garbage collecting but it is difficult parallelize the work to do. The goal of this project is to improve the garbage collector actually used by Mono with new techniques and algorithms for a better parallel work distribution to improve his scalability and performance in a parallel environment
