I'd like to have OpenKeychain better integrated within the android system and external apps as well has having itself easy to use. This makes me interested in the following proposal ideas:
- Automatic contact discovery
- Integration of OpenKeychain into Android's contact app
- Improvements to file encryption/decryption
as well as fixing bugs and todos in the OpenKeychain api.
