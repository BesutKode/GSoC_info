We propose to implement a library that provides unified resolution of
dependencies across platforms (Ubuntu, OS X, ...) and installers (APT, Homebrew,
pip, ...). The rosdep tool is currently used for this purpose in the ROS
community. We develop an independent library, based on the ideas of rosdep,
which can be used to declare and install system dependencies in a platform
independent way. The developed library and tools are applicable to ROS and other
software alike.
