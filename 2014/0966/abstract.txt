Flumotion is an essential part of the backend of the streaming system used by TimVideos.us to stream content live. Flumotion uses GStreamer 0.10 at its core. GStreamer has now moved to version 1.2.3 and version 0.10 is no longer being maintained. There will be no more releases, not even bug-fixes. Also, GStreamer 1.x provides many architectural advantages over the 0.10 version. So, Flumotion needs to be ported to the new version.
