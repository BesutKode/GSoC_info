My GSoC project focuses on two libraries of LibffCall : Avcall and Vcall. Source code of the libraries is pretty abandoned and no proper implementation of autotools. Separate script exist for linking the platform specific code to C, which have to be updated by a single configure script. Man pages are not properly maintained and scripted. Implementation of proper GNU standards as the existing code is a mess. Merging of assemble code into a single file for specific platform needs to be done.
