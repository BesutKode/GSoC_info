I have used most of linux desktop environments ranging from gnome2,gnome-shell(GNOME3),Unity,  KDE  ,LXDE , XFCE , e17, mate, cinnamon. I really think we need a new desktop environment for touch-friendly devices and small-form PC that include Raspberry PI. I have been using Firefox OS on my keon for some months now and I have lately tried the desktop build with tablet UI.this project may ultimately lead to dedicated linux distro for Mozilla Devs.
