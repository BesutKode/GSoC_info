The aim of this project is to enhance user's experience with PRISM by allowing the user to view and interactively explore state graphs. I propose to use JGraphX (A Java Swing diagramming (graph visualization) library) and additionally GraphML (An XML based file format for realizing graphs) for the same. This would add more features to the existing PRISM framework and would also help in delivering a better working environment to the user.
