I'm going to develop a new platform for creating beagleboard interactive tutorials.This platform will be develop and design in an interactive way allowing users to easily create tutorials. The platform will allow all type of users to create interactive tutorials for sharing with the beagleboard community. The difference between other platform will be that this platform will allow the user to run the code if they have a board. This is a great advantage allowing user to run the tutorials live.
