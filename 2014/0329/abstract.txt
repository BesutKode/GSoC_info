There is a great quantity of devices that are powered by Allwinner processors, including but not limited to the various Cubieboards, OLinuXinos, STBs, Tablets and “Mini PCs”. These devices have become a prime target for makers and tinkerers because of their low price, unbrickability, lack of software locks and ease of software customization. However, support on mainline Linux is not yet feature complete. I would therefore like to work on improving said support.
