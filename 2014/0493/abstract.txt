pgmpy is working on reading from and writing to various file formats. ProbModelXML is one of them. Now more formats like Elvira, DNET - 1, XMLBIF, MSBNx, pomdpX, Cassandraâ€™s Format etc. are being added to make these compatible while working with pgmpy. My project deals with implementing popdpX, XMLBIF formats during the course of GSoC. This way models can be specified in a uniform format and readily converted to bayesian or markov model objects.
