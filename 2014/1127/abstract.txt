Making CCExtractor usable for other developers is very important. Why reinvent the wheel if someone else already built a nice library or a nice program for it? This is the main goal of this proposal, making CCExtractor better so that it can be easily verified that it’s correctly working (through the Testing program), making it embeddable in other programs (refactoring + “librarizing”) and finally implementing a black-spot on the supported standards (the DVB subtitles).
