An idea of this project is to equip HTTPSEverywhere with a mechanism to fetch and apply updates to rulesets would greatly improve the speed at which updates to rulesets can be distributed.  HTTPSEverywhere is one of few addons that I feel I absolutely must have installed on any browser I use for the security it adds to the browser. I would like to now take the opportunity to contribute to this astounding tool to help to make it easier for ruleset creators to keep it updated and the web secure.
