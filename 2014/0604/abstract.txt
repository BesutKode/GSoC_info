Neo4j Spatial is a plugin for the Neo4j graph database that provides geospatial operations within the context of a graph database. Neo4j Spatial implements an R-Tree in the graph to allow for efficient processing of geographical data. In addition to a native Java API, Neo4j provides an interface to the graph through a query language called Cypher.  Neo4j Spatial functionality is not currently available in Cypher. This project proposes integrating Spatial functionality with Cypher.
