RelEx parses a sentence using Link-Grammar which produces sub-graphs. By matching patterns on these, RelEx can extract information which – as of now – pertains to gender, number and part of speech. On the way to an AGI, RelEx – as part of the OpenCog system – would need to learn how to make inferences and deductions from its input. This can be achieved by mapping it with RelEx2Logic rules to and adapting the existing implementation of probabilistic logic networks.
