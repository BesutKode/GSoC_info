LibreOffice's dialogs are described in .src files which is a custom format. Positions and sizes of elements are fixed, e.g. the size of a cancel button is the width of the longest translation of Cancel in all supported languages. There is a large effort underway to retrofit a more modern layout approach to our existing code.

The task is to help complete the remaining 20% of dialogs that need converting to the new format.
