I would like to work on GPU extensions for Breeze, including matrix factorizations (LU, SVD, etc.), linear systems solver and as much of Breeze's functionalities as possible. This is an exciting topic, combining many interesting ideas: functional programming in Scala, numerical methods and GPU computing. As of now, probably the most popular tool for scientific computing is Python/SciPy. I would very much like to be a part of the revolution in that field and replace Python with Scala.
