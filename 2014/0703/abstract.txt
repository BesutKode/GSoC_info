GenApp is a modular framework for multiscale science computations. Apache Airavata is a software framework for executing and managing computational jobs and workflows on distributed computing resources. The primary goal of this project is to integrate GenApp with Airavata to be able to exexcute long running computational jobs.GenApp also needs to be integrated with Airavata to enable composition and execution of workflows. GenApp needs to be integrated with Airavata's Messaging System as well.
