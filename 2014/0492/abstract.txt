Dive computers are important devices for divers, and thus they form a central part in the working of Subsurface. Some dive computers allow configuration via software. The project I am proposing adds this feature to Subsurface. I intend to add a feature to enable users configure dive computers from the Subsurface GUI. Implementing dive computer will make it easier for users to configure their devices using a computer GUI, and also back up their settings and restore them later if necessary.
