Tours are a set of related places with supporting media, visited in a defined timeline, which can be played back, and are useful for a range of tasks, like highlighting places of interest for sightseeing, or taking a trip of the highest skyscrapers of the world, or even showing historic events and political changes happening over decades. Even though the Marble library currently supports these use cases but the UI does not reveal all the features yet. This project is about making them possible.
