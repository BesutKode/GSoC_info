Developing a remoteproc firmware which will allow high level languages to access PRU (programmable real time unit) functionality on the Beaglebone Black via remote procedure calls. The firmware on the PRU will support a small interpreter which can receive code fragments from the client language and execute them in a loop. The scripting language is similar to Chris rogers Botspeak. Developing this library will allow language independent runtime control over the PRU.
