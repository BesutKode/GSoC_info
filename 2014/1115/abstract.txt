The Linux Driver Verification project is aimed to develop an open source framework for checking correctness of Linux kernel modules against rule specifications with different static verifiers. LDV Tools can find even more bugs in the Linux kernel modules, than can be reported by the LDV developers. In order to solve this problem it is suggested to develop the public pool of bugs, which will provide all data needed for analysis to module developers.
