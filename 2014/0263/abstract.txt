Gnome Maps is an on going development maps application for the Gnome Desktop Environment.

In the latest release has been added the routing feature but a must have feature is missing: people canâ€™t add intermediate points.

The main goal of my proposal is to add support to via points in Gnome Maps.

Mattias Bengtsson (Gnome Maps) and  Peter Karich (GraphHopper) are the mentors for this project.
