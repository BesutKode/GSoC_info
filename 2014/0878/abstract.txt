My work is aimed towards providing ePub rendering capabilities in Atril, the document viewer of the Mate desktop environment. On the completion of this project the Mate document viewer will be able to successfully render and display ePub publications without the need of any additional software. This would be a step further in providing complete document reading capabilities to the users.
