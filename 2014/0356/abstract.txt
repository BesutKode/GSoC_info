With the introduction of BioMart implementation support by Ensembl it has become easy to view more correlation tables between datasets and the Ensembl Genes 75, Ensembl Variation 75, Ensembl Regulation 75, Vega 55 and PRIDE databases. Although they can be viewed online using BioMart online browser PathVisio still lacks a way to show this information. This plugin aims at displaying this information for annotated gene products in a pathway that have Ensembl as their database.
