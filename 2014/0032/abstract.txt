Nowadays, machine translation is very common and fast tool, which we use for understanding foreign languages. My idea is focused on developing English-Kazakh machine translation on Apertium, a free/open-source machine translation platform. I plan to continue working on this project, reach a good WER and coverage. I believe that my work will be useful for the society and other developments.
