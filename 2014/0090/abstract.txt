The goals of this project are twofold:
A)  Speed-up dual-tree traversal algorithms in mlpack.
1)  Define a set of benchmarks.
2)  Improve the speed of the tree traversal as measured by these benchmarks.
3)  Document, test, and support this code.

B)  Implement various trees in a manner consistent with the current API.
1) X-tree
2) R*-tree
3) R-tree
4) Hilbert-R-tree
5) UB-tree
6) M-tree
