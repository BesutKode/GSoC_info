The JFace viewer framework is useful for tools that interact
with the User interface. Although it is a widely used API, JFace viewers
do not support Java 1.6 features. Therefore, developers have to adapt their work to supply the absence of Generics using explicit casts and type
checking. During this process, time is wasted implementing repetitive
solutions, resulting in a verbose code. Extending the current API to support Generics could be useful to improve the quality of client programs.
