This project aims to improve upon the existing app by improving both internal structure and external user experience, the former by replacing and redoing certain modules of the app(JSON Parsing,HTTP Requests and Exception Handling) and the latter by redesigning the UI so it conforms to the latest standards and specifications of Android Design, as well as adding extra features to the code input such as Syntax Highlighting and options to record and store custom inserts
