In my proposal of GSoC 2014, I am applying for Xapianâ€˜s Learning to Rank project.

During this summer, I plan to complete three tasks:
1.to optimize the existing three algorithms(refactor the code)
2.to complete a test framework for learning to rank algorithm
3.to complete a feature selection algorithm for ranking
