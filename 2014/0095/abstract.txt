MapKnitter is a tool used for 'combining a series of these aerial images into a flat, projected map ' which can be browsed in the same way as Google Maps. It is built on old and legacy code for its editing interface using Open Layers which is a complex and heavy library following strict design principles and requires time to develop features on. Porting the interface to Leaflet.js (a light weight library of 33 KB) will make feature addition and editing  easy because of its object model.
