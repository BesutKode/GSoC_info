This project works to create a virtual classroom for new fedora contributors. Acts as a platform for new contributors to engage with the community and learn how they can contribute best in the community. Mostly this service will be used to run online courses on contributing at various levels be it documentation, bug-fixing or packaging. The project would certainly increase the activeness in the community and certainly make it easy for newer members to craft their way around the fedora community.
