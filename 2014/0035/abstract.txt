GNSS-SDR could become a great tool for students and researchers attempting to understand the internals of a GNSS receiver. If the cost of the hardware platform could be brought low and the hardware robustness is made reasonably high, many more experimenters will be willing to join the GNSS-SDR project.  In this project, I would like to develop and test an Open Sourced Hardware design for a GNSS Sampler frontend using the Maxim Integrated MAX2769 Universal GPS Receiver.
