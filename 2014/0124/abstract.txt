The Clojure programming language uses a bootstrapped runtime, for which it trades off startup time and memory to enable REPL development and code injection. Once an application is deployment ready, this dynamic behavior is often not needed and so the dynamism upside no longer offsets the  performance costs. I propose to design and implement a Clojure compiler capable of mitigating these dynamism costs for a subset of Clojure.
