IDLE is a IDE which comes bundled with Python. It currently lacks full test coverage,and misses some common features like line-numbering and ability to integrate 3rd party code checkers. These are few issues with IDLE which make it a “disposable” IDE – novices use it only to later leave to another IDE, once they have gained some knowledge. The project aims to address these issues by extending IDLE test coverage , adding of line numbering and ability to integrate 3rd party code checkers.
