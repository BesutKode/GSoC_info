Subcortical brain structures mediate many cognitive processes, such as emotion and memory. The most widely used tool to study deep brain activity fMRI. Although fMRI offers excellent spatial resolution, its temporal resolution is slow compared to other brain imaging techniques, such as EEG and MEG. MNE-Python currently employs algorithms to localize sources of cortical M/EEG activity. I propose to utilize these algorithms to localize sources from subcortical spaces.
