Cross Site Request Forgery is a very effective and hard to defend attack. OWASP CSRFGuard will be an attempt to mitigate all CSRF attacks in web application without developersâ€™ intervention.  Every CSRF attack would be identified by Apache and further actions will be taken as per configuration. Also a lightweight php library would be developed to mitigate CSRF attacks in web applications in such a way that developers can use them while building web applications or integrate to existing one.
