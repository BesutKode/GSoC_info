Treewidth is a well-known metric on undirected graphs that measures how tree-like a graph is and gives a notion of graph decomposition that proves to be useful in solving problems which were earlier known to be difficult. 

The goals of the project are to 1) Constructing an efficient data-structure for storing tree decomposition. 2)Implementing some efficient tree-decomposition heuristics. 3)Some sample applications (e.g Independent set).
