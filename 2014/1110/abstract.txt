Marconi has support for two different storage engines, MongoDB and SQLAlchemy. While these are great storage options, we just cannot settle with only that.

Different user needs would require different storage solutions, and being one step ahead by providing support for them is an expected feature from a software solution like Marconi.

The main goal of this proposal is to identify a storage engine that fits Marconi's interests and to implement a driver for it.
