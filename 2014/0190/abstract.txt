This proposal targets identified problems with BGE acknowledged in Blender's roadmap along with plans for better integration as an interactive mode. The proposal aims to be a first step in that direction by addressing the bug tracker and known problematic parts of the GE.
By the end of the program, the results should be less bugs and pending patches, parts of functionality/code more bug-proof and suitable for integration, happier users and a document identifying problems to be addressed next.
