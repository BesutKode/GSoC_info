Segway aims to find patterns in genomic data by segmenting the data, and assigning
a small number of labels to each segment, and then using an unsupervised learning
algorithm to discover patterns in the data. I aim to improve Segwayâ€™s ability to describe
genome patterns by implementing features of a Dynamic Bayesian Network, specifically
its ability to further segment into hierarchical labels, to reveal patterns at different scales.
