To better coordinate their efforts and to share up-to-date resources with each other, Peace Corps Volunteers (PCVs) in Azerbaijan tested out using the Ushahidi Platform as an online database for collecting information about sites and projects. Through the testing process, the PCVs identified several changes to Ushahidi that would improve usability and enhance the overall experience. I am part of the team that is making these customizations and tailoring Ushahidi to suit the needs of the PCVs.
