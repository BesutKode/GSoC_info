This project aims at designing a lightweight yet scalable persistent layer for the IoTSyS gateway. Since the IoTSyS gateway run on the resource-low Raspberry Pi (RPi) platform, an in-memory cache layer should be presented to minimize access to the database. The database system in turn, is chosen to relax the requirement on ACID transactions and focus on read/write operation. Moreover, a scalable design is crucial due to the lack of storage on the RPi platform.
