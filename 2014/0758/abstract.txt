In days of international surveillance the protection of private data and communication is as important as never before. Especially mail, which passes many server and most of the time via unencrypted links, requires end-to-end encryption and authentication. The two most common methods for mail encryption and verification are PGP and S/MIME. Trojit√° doesn't support neither the one nor the other. In this years Google Summer Of Code I want to change that and implement a support for PGP and S/MIME.
