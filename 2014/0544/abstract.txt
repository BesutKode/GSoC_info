In this project, we aim to add Markdown features to Bugzilla comments. Currently, Bugzilla comments are plain-text-based and do not support HTML structures. This project involves implementing most of the Markdown standard structures as well as some additions to it by Github Flavoured Markdown features. Finally, we will have a documentation written for end users to help them know what structures are supported by Bugzilla Markdown engine.
