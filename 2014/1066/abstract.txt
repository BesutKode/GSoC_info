In order for FreeFlow to offer the same support as the onf2013 submission, OpenFlow versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.0, and 1.3.1 must all be included. A state machine must also be present to handle the establishment of a connection between a switch and controller. Integration with the controller must allow FreeFlow to easily support new OpenFlow versions as they come out.
