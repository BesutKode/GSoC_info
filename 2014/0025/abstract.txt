Stanbol provides a set of components for Semantic Content Management. One of the components is the Enhancer, which can be used to extract features from content. The Enhancer is organized using Enhancements Chains, which defines how the content will be processed but they don't allow to integrate the current process with the business layer

The goal of the proposal is to bring EIP to  Stanbol for easing the integration of the Enhancement workflows within the business layer of enterprise systems.
