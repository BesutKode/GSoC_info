I plan to extend the libcmis in order to provide means to connect with Microsoft SharePoint and OneDrive instances. I find this project to be extremely important as companies that have been using Microsoft products by their own or in collaboration with other companies can easily migrate to an open source solution and still have the main features available. I firmly believe that implementing this feature will further increase LibreOfficeâ€™s popularity among business companies.
