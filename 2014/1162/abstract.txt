This proposal attempts to allow a program written in JSBML to map CellDesignerâ€™s plug-in data structure to a JSMBL data structure, among other goals. First, the SMBL Layout Extension and Render Extension will be used to clone the CellDesigner network layout. Second, JSBML-based plugins will pull data from CellDesigner so the CellDesigner model will be fully represented in JSBML. Finally, a plug-in will be developed that will randomly generate a biochemical network and will be written in JSBML.
