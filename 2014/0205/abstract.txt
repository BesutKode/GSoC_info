Netengine is a python device abstraction layer which allows to remotely obtain all the important and needed information about the devices attached to a network, both in a python dictionary and in JSON format.
It works with  network protocols such as SSH (Secure SHell)  and SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol).
With this abstraction layer every device is treated as an programming language object, with its own methods and attributes to be retrieved.
