Otruta is an activist group cooperation tool built upon Tox framework. It features a push-to-talk mode of communication, a web-of-trust oriented coordination model and a mobile client empowered with QR/NFC as means of spreading out of band information. Otruta aims to replace commercial software like Zello in civil society self-organization applications, providing better confidentiality and flexibility with hopes of becoming a powerful weapon for emerging bottom-up and horizontal democracies.
