This is a proposal to extend the work on the 2D Arrangements visualization in Qt4 from GSoC 2012.  We'll add code for visualizing and interacting with 2D polyline, Bezier, and algebraic curve types, as well as 3D spherical geodesic curves. In addition, this project will contribute Arrangement-specific components to the Qt Graphics View framework and general design changes to provide dual support for Qt4 and Qt5.
