As a student in aerospace engineering at University of Stuttgart, I'm always looking forward for new challenges in that field. Also i think especially in the DGSN Project of AerospaceResearch.Net, there are  opportuninies not only in space applications. As I already did some work for DSGN in the past, i'm willing to share some more time with it.
