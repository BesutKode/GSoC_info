Traveling Salesman(TSP)  and vehicle Routing(VRP)  have been a very interesting and challenging problem in the area of Operations Research . . pgRouting currently has implementations for TSP and Capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows.  The idea here is to develop a more generic solver  for  these problems which can be done by refactoring the current VRP solver and then write wrappers for other specific variations of the same problem particularly for TSP  and  CVRP.
