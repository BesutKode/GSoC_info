First goal of this proposal is to implement efficient testing of a matroid for membership of various classes and to perform single element extensions of matroids that exploit the knowledge that a given matroid belongs to a certain class, to have lower complexity. We also propose implementation of visualization techniques and an application of matroid theory in form of enumeration of network codes for a multisource network coding problem which is one of the timely problems in information  theory.
