The CernVM Contextualization Process involves three entities- µCernVM bootloader, Amiconfig and CloudInit. We can streamline them by modifying the micro-contextualization process, overriding the default CloudInit initialization and adding a custom part-handler for Amiconfig. This will reduce the ‘number of ways user data are fetched’ X ‘techniques of user data interpretation’ thereby reducing boot time delay of CernVM.
