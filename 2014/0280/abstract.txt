Currently phpMyAdmin has an error reporting server, which collects information about javascript errors and an error reporting module which sends reports only of javascript errors to the error reporting server. In this project I propose to extend the existing error reporting module and server for collecting runtime PHP errors as well. PMA's current error reporting server needs many improvements. Implementation of some of them are also proposed as a part of this project.
