The web_console gem was developed under GSOC 2013 as a standalone console interface running on top of a Rails application. The gem extends the usability of the current Rails console by allowing it to run on the browser with all of the userâ€™s shell settings intact. The next step for web_console is to bring it to the Rails error page coupled with some other features that make debugging easier for developers.
