I intend to make a basic 2.5d sidescroller, with weight/physics related puzzles and multiple levels about a penguin stuck in the Sahara. The levels will be blocky and basic.

Prep:
Getting familiar with engine and community. Basic art to be done as well. 

Midterm:
I hope to have all the big engine modifications and additions made at this point.

Final:
I will be looking for ways to further improve the project and engine.
