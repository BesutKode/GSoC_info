The actor model and its implementation in the Akka library for Scala have proven their use for developing concurrent applications. However, the expression of an actorâ€™s internal behavior using plain Scala is relatively clumsy. It seems this may be improved when the internal behavior is specified using a Scala extension named SubScript, which is based on the theory Algebra of Communicating Processes.
The aim is to get Akka actors working together with SubScript.
