OpenWorm relies on myriad storage formats to accomplish its goal of simulating C. Elegans. Although components of the project are served well by these formats, they must be combined into cohesive presentations. Currently, combining distinct data sources is ad hoc and susceptible to breakage when new storage formats are adopted. I propose to virtualize access to the different storage formats into RDF to improve this situation.
