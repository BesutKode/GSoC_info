Software components are properly divided into modules so that it is easy for developers to maintain and reuse them without unnecessary cost. Currently, some OpenStack modules utilizing VMware API have some sort of duplicates and have not made use of a shared library. In this project, I would like to update a current shared library, called oslo.vmware, so that this library will be used and shared by modules in OpenStack.
