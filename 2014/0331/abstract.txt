Biopythonâ€™s SeqIO package is used to parse sequence files such as the popular FASTA format and heavily annotated formats like GenBank flat file format. Currently the module will completely parse a sequence prior to returning a sequence record object. By implementing an indexing and lazy loading sequence parser, Biopython can enable more efficient use of large sequence files such as chromosomes or entire genomes.
