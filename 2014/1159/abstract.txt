The steady-state distribution of a Markov chain is an important quantity to analyse the corresponding biological system. We focus on developing simulation-based methods to calculate the steady-state distribution of relatively large Markov chains, which can lead us to estimate the modelâ€™s parameters by fitting the calculated steady-state distribution with the experimental measurements. Simulation-based methods, e.g., perfect simulation, are expected to be programmed as a component of PRISM.
