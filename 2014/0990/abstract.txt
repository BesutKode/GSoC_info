Tor Weather provides an email notification service to any user who wants to monitor the status of a Tor node. It's codebase is pretty much unmaintained these days. The first part of this project would be to simplify the code by fetching Tor network status data from Onionoo rather than running a local tor client and listening for consensus events. The second part would involve cleaning up of the codebase by making it more compact and closing some of the open tickets.
