Clang’s C++/CLI compiler depends on Microsoft’s own compiler to be built. This dependency limits its applicability to Microsoft platforms. By replacing Mono.Cecil with Mono’s unmanaged metadata reading API the compiler can become multi platform and used by more developers. Moreover, I intend to work on the backend implementation of ref classes. Ref classes are being parsed by the compiler, however, the llvm backend does not know how to generate them yet.
