For a Microfinance institution it is useful to have a way of presenting  overall client details and other institution details in a high level manner. This information may be useful to external parties that involve with the institutions such as funders and investors. Idea of this project is to provide such a capability to Mifos using a Client Impact Portal. This project consists of both the backend support and frontend for the user who intend to retrieve high level detail of the institutions.
