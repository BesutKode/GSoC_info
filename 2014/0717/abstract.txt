The target of this project is to create a space game with PySoy adding the necessary features to the engine. The first half of the project is to add general functionality to the soy.scenes.Space class to enable rendering and physics simulation of such outer space scenes and create a simple game with it, where you can fly around and shoot asteroids. The second part of the project extends this game and the functionality by improving a specific area of the game which is either graphics or AI.
