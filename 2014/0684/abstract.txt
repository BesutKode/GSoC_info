While the Network Analyzer and the Centiscape app between them offer a number of important and useful measures to analyse networks, it is still a challenge for users and developers to make use of the existing code in their apps. Thus comes the need to develop an API to expose Network Analyzer and Centiscape functions. Google Pagerank and HITS algorithms would be good additions to the existing suit of algorithms and functionality provided by Network Analyzer.
