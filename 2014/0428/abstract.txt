One of the reasons of bad query plans is inadequate cost estimation of individual operations. The optimizer sometimes uses hard-coded constants for cost estimation. One problem with the calibration procedure of these constants is that they depend on the actual hardware where MariaDB is run.
The aim of this project is to provide a framework to use self-tuning cost coefficients, which would help in user specific optimal cost estimation.
