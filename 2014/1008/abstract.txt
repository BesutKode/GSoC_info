Radar is a highly diverse radio technology for object detection, ranging and velocimetry.
The purpose of this project is to develop an out-of-tree module for the GNU Radio project that provides a generic environment to experiment with various radar types. Some of the most commonly used radar processing algorithms shall be implemented.
Universal Software Radio Peripherals from Ettus Research and adequate daughterboards are intended to be used for transmission and reception of real signals.
