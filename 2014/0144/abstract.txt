Meemoo.org is a platform for web-hackable creative image/animation apps. Noflojs.org is a more-powerful dataflow environment, with hooks to Node.js and Arduino. This project idea involves designing a Canvas 2d library of Noflo components which will allow Meemoo components to be ported as Noflo subgraphs. Having this library implemented on Noflojs we will start migrating Meemoo apps to this new environment and make Meemoo closer to a WebMaker integration.
