My goal is to implement full JACK (JACK Audio Connection Kit) support in MuseScore 2.0. MuseScore already has a Jack Audio support, but doesn't have a support of Jack MIDI In/Out and Jack Transport.

Features to be implemented:
1. Jack MIDI Out: outputs midi messages.
2. Jack Transport: start, stop and seek.
3. Jack MIDI In: handles incoming midi messages.
4. Jack Audio: outputs an audio.

These features will give an ability to connect with lots of synthesizers and DAWs.
