GlitterGallery is an amazing designer collaboration platform being developed by folks at the Fedora design team. The goals are to allow designers to easily share their work, gather and parse feedback in a useful way, and version their work just as developers are able to. GlitterGallery will be somewhat biased to support SVGs from Inkscape, and to work with the magicmockup rapid prototyping program.  This proposal aims to improve GlitterGallery in a way explained in the document.
