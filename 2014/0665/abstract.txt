LLDB is the debugger from LLVM projects. As GDB on FreeBSD is out-dated due to license issues, we are seeing a recent success of porting a new debugger -- LLDB to FreeBSD. Currently, LLDB supports userland debugging on amd64, mips and i386 platforms. However, kernel debugging is not implemented yet and it is listed as a long-term goal. In this GSoC project, I'm aiming to enable kernel debugging for LLDB on FreeBSD.
