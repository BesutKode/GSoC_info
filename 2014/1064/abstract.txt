Boolean operations on paths and stroke-to-path conversion are an important part of many design workflows and form a building block for more complex tools. The current implementation of these operations in Inkscape has many shortcomings.

This project will implement Boolean operations and path stroking in the 2Geom computational geometry library used by Inkscape and provide an easy to use API to access them.
