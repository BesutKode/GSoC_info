The aim of this project is to create an integrated Git Manager Tool for Processing. The tool will provide a mix of offline Git features integrated with the  features that numerous online repository services provide, most notably GitHub, BitBucket and SourceForge. The tool will consist of an intuitive UI modeled off of Processing's UI, and will not only aim at catering to "pro" Git users, but also act as a medium to introduce new users to the world of Git.
