Ensemble vector field (EVF) visualization is currently not supported in the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). I suggest multiple tasks. The first, is loading ensemble data from the NetCDF file format. The second, is computation of finite-time variance analysis (FTVA) for an EVF. The third, is to provide visualization of clusters in the variance data from FTVA. Lastly, as an optional item if time permits, is the inclusion of TRACLUS, a trajectory clustering algorithm for use within VTK.
