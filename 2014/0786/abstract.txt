Expected project results include:
- an implementation of the MDP-Flow2 algorithm, performing significantly better than all of currently implemented in OpenCV
- preparing a testing framework for optical flow estimation functions in OpenCV based on Middlebury methodology and dataset

If there is enough time:
- an original modification to the algorithm (not to use SIFT and be patent-free), 
- CUDA - enabled version of it
