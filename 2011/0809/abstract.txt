Tux, of Math command is an open-source educational game for learning Mathematics. Since the game is quite popular and used by many schools, my idea focuses on improving the learning of a player/student by providing a personalized, adaptive game-play. This is done by modelling the student's knowledge state using Bayesian networks. It also helps a teacher/supervisor to be provided with a detailed assessment about a particular student's strengths and weaknesses in individual concepts.
