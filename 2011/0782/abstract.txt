Haiku currently runs well in VirtualBox, and all basic emulated hardware works well enough for general use. However, there is currently no port of the guest additions to Haiku, so the emulated system is not as usable as it could be. I propose to implement these additions to provide extra features such as seamless mouse pointer integration, clipboard sharing, and automatic screen resizing.
