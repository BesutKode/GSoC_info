Currently the process of authoring meta-metadata wrappers in a text editor and finding XPath expressions in the web browser is a difficult and time-consuming process even for an experienced developer.After the completion of this project an unnecessary load of template generation will be removed. Developer will be able to select data on page and simply add them in template with a user defined attribute, all other details like generation of xPath and ambiguous cases will be resolved automatically.
