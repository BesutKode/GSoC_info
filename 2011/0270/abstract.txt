This project will have two major goals.
First, I will improve libmv API so that Blender can easily leverage all features provided by libmv. 
This will ease the task of the developer tasked with Blender UI implementation.
Then, My focus will be on completing the 2D tracker algorithms.
Currently, libmv can only work as a completely automatic detector and tracker.
However, real use cases will need to allow the user to provide additional inputs and tweak the results.
