AbiWord currently does not support automatic hyphenation.  Hyphenation programs used in computerized typesetting employ varied techniques often in combination to determine where to break the last word on a line. Usually, a dictionary lookup procedure is combined with a "logical hyphenation program" which bases its decisions on the recognitionof certain characters, strings of characters, or patterns of vowels and consonants. And I try to Integrate the 'hunspell' dictionaries for hyphenation.
