The aim of the project is to design and implement an Android application called Historify, which would display the list of interactions (phone calls, SMS, FB messages, etc.) between the user and a selected contact, in a conversational form. 

The key element of the project is to support openness: Historify would provide a mechanism allowing 3rd party apps to post events on the timeline (via shared content providers or Intent calls).
