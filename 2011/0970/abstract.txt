I'm a gradudate students in Dartmouth College Computer Science, I started to work in the field of mobile sensing from last summer, with focus on phone camera. I've been working with OpenCV on iPhone for a while, I successfully implemented and ported 3D head pose tracking, eye gaze tracking, AMM fitting algorithms on an iPhone.  Prior to this, I worked on several computer vision and machine learning projects. I'm experienced in developing vision project in C with OpenCV, familiar with iOS and Android.
