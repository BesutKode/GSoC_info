Many people would like to use VoIP in our mesh network, but they encounter some problems: most of existent VoIP solutions depend from Internet; they don't have a good mobile phone integration and they don't support IPv6; and also, the Internet bandwidth in our network is going towards exhaustion. So, the project's aim is to create a distributed VoIP network compatible with VoIP clients, integrated in a social network and easily accessible.
