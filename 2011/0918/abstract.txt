The goal of this project is to design and develop a stored procedure interface which will enable users to write, store and run procedures on the server and make the whole thing pluggable so that users not needing this interface may opt not to use the interface. Stored procedures was stripped out during the intial fork from MySQL 6.0 but taking into account the requests from users of Drizzle it has become a need right now.
