My proposal is for a rewoking of the kerneloops.org webpage, which includes but may not be limited to:
-Cleaning up structure
-Cleaning up code
-Encapsulation of modules
-Migrating perl code to PHP
-Benchmarking different NoSQL databases
-Migrating MySQL to the most suitable database from the above benchmark
-Extending site making it more user friendly
