The current implementation of spin in Sympy covers single spin states and the operators that can act on them; however, there is no means of dealing with spin states in multiple particle systems, which requires Clebsch-Gordon/Wigner symbols. Sympy currently has functions capable of calculating Clebsch-Gordon coefficients numerically; this project will focus on implementing a symbolic means of manipulating these coefficients and expand the spin implementation to utilize these coefficients.
