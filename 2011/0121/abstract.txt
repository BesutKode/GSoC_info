I would like to add support to emulate the Motorola 680X0 based NeXt computers to QEMU. After first implementing the changes necessary to the current M68k code, I would then implement the I/O needed to boot the firmware, likely starting with serial console support and then adding framebuffer and keyboard/mouse support. This would allow many to experience the influential NeXTStep OS, which not only became Mac OS X, but was the host environment for the world's first web server.
