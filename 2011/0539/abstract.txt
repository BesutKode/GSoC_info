The project involves the development of a canvas-based network interaction visualization prototype for biological interaction networks and pathways having various common nodes of metabolism. Majority of the pathway visualization tools involve Flash. The project developed would have more features like real-time collaboration etc., as well as utilize HTML 5 features allowing it to be light-weight and that can run in both modern browsers in a full-fledged computer, or in a tablet (e.g. ipad).
