This project aims at building up a GUI based package of R to assist the preparation and solution of optimization problems. It is anticipated to improve the usability of optimization tools in R by providing users with meaningful suggestions on the choice of optimizer and parameters through a visible and interactive way. The program will also provide a mechanism to auto-generate codes that could be run in R to solve a specific optimization problem.
