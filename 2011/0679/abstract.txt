Currently the Plugin manager is not very intuitive for a new user.
This project is an attempt to make the plugin manager a little feature rich and more intuitive for the end user(s) and add new features optimize existing ones.
At this moment, the plugin manager's design is very simple and does provide all basic features in place.
With the new plugin and template manager, the aim is to make using and adding plugins almost 1 click without loosing the simplicity in design.
