This project continues in the development of GRASS GIS 3D visualizaton tool wxNviz based on wxPython and underlying OGSF library. 
The goal is to add missing functionality so that wxNviz's predecessor written in Tcl/Tk could be replaced by completed wxNviz in GRASS 7. 
The plan is to add missing features like animations or cutting planes and additionally implement better view control.
