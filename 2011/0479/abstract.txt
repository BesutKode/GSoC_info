Several Tcl_Obj types, for example lambdas, use the internal representation to cache information that can be, but is expensive to, compute from the string representation. It is currently not possible to use such caching purely from the script level. This proposal is to create a script level mechanism for (i) defining data to cache, the computation of which would be done by an ordinary Tcl command, and (ii) accessing cached data. I expect to make use of TclOO.
