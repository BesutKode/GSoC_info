GCC allows plugins and this give new opportunities. This allows to add rules which are specific to a project while the heart of GCC is made to be generic. The idea of this project is to write a plugin, which can be used to add more warnings when compiling, helping to improve the quality of the code. For this, I would like to use MELT, which is a plugin simplifying the writing of others plugins. This is still very simple checks but it can helps to respect commonly used rules.
