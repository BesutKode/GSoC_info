The open source speech recognition program simon allows users to interface with programs via speech commands.  Currently, the scenarios used to interface with programs can either be activated or deactivated, and they have a single grammar which they follow at all times. Implementing context dependent speech recognition would allow scenarios to be activated, deactivated, or altered based on the current context of the user.  This system will help improve performance, accuracy and convenience.
