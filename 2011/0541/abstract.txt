Neologism is a powerful RDF Vocabulary publishing platform and is already being used in the RDF community. However, using it in existing Drupal sites is difficult since there is no dedicated D7 Module. Moreover, there is no alternate vocabulary publishing solution available at the moment. Carrying forward the work already put into Neologism, I intend to port it to D7 and making it available to the huge Drupal community and any existing Drupal sites that want to use  customized RDF vocabularies.
