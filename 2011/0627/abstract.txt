Web Citations are currently the most popular form of citation on the Wikipedia project for inline references. They have the common of "dieing" when the URLs either change or the servers that they are hosted on go down. Given the nature of wikipedia and the need for verifiability this creates a significant content problem when sources that are used in articles are no longer available.
