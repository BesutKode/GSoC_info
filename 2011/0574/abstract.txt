Tapestry is a component oriented framework for creating dynamic, robust, highly scalable web applications in Java that lacks a built-in mechanism to protect web applications against cross-site request forgery[1]. 
The goal of this project is to create a Tapestry built-in protection mechanism that secures Tapestry applications against CSRF attacks.
