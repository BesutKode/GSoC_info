This project aims to integrate the current standalone OCR module into the s3 framework where the forms could be generated as PDF and user could upload a scanned image and then get an interface where the scanned information is displayed on the screen along with the corresponding image counterparts for the manual verification. There will be two use cases, (1) bulk upload (manual verification will be done later ) and (2) upload and verify both at once, which will be incorporated into s3 framework.
