Scilab is numerical computational package which is widely used for high precision scientific computing. Currently, the elementary functions in scilab use the ones provided by maths library of native compilers - Visual C on windows and gcc on linux. This project aims to provide a common math library on all platforms, at least for high precision requiring functions - sin, cos, pow etc., to ensure results with acceptable variations(if not exactly same) across different platforms.
