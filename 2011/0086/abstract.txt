Syntactic sugar features to simplify the use of Pig.

-- Variable argument for SAMPLE and LIMIT.
Currently, SAMPLE and LIMIT only take a constant argument. It would be better to be able to use a variable (scalar) in the place of a constant.

-- Default SPLIT destination.
SPLIT partitions a relation into two or more relations.
It would be useful to have a default destination for tuples that are not assigned to any other relation, in a fashion similar to a switch/case/default statement.
