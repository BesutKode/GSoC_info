Improve border corner rendering and interaction of dashed /dotted styles with other styles.

Currently the -moz-border-radius doesnt work well with a few styles. The project would aim to better implement the same.
The css styles dotted and dashed dont interact well with double / solid. The implemenation of these needs to be improved.
