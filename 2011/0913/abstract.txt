Ship detection and classification in large open swaths of ocean is tough due to factors like low image resolution and false targets. But with the increasing importance in monitoring ship traffic in both coastal and open ocean, an automatic algorithm for the detection of ships and their wakes is very desirable. In this project, I will develop an automatic ship and wake detection algorithm in Opticks that can identify and classify vessels based on velocity and heading using Radon transforms.
