The Sensor Simulator will be enhanced in 3 steps.

Firstly, by polishing the GUI.

Secondly, by extending the supported sensors with the gyroscope and with the rotation vector.

Thirdly, by adding the feature to generate sensors output, giving a scenario for device movement. The user can choose a set of initial states and the time for transition between them. The scenario will be obtained interpolating the sensors values for the initial states.
