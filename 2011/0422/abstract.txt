Currently, the openSUSE Build Service (OBS) mobile client offers very limited functions. I would like to improve and extend the OBS mobile interface for Android. The goals include not only adding powerful functionalities such as sorting requests by different criteria and enabling real-time user actions, but also integrating a mobile test-suite for each new feature, and ultimately improving the overall user experience that will make the OBS mobile interface more efficient and convenient to use.
