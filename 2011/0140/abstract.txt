Real-time syntax validation helps programmers prevent careless mistakes, such as missing semi-colons and using undefined symbols, by highlighting these errors as they happen. In the project, this idea is to be extended in Pathvisio for biological pathway diagrams. Thus, there's a need to develop a view in Pathvisio which highlights the errors. This validation framework needs to be generic, allowing other developers to create their own rule-sets against which the pathway diagrams are validated.
