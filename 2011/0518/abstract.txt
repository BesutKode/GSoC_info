I wish to convert LimeSurvey's administration procedural code to object oriented one in CodeIgniter which follow MVC architecture. It will be complete 1:1 mapping in first place. Secondly, i will replace normal HTML tables that we use at many screens like List Users with jqGrid. Use of jqGrid will simplify the UI, provide some basic functionality like export, selection etc at screens where we don't have it.And finally, i will integrate the Installer that i have made before.
