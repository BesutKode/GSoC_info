This project will implement a new wizard for K-9 providing users with a very easy way to set up new mail accounts. It will search for accounts on the devices. It will try to configure them using various mechanisms also used by the Thunderbird e-mail client. These consist of using the Mozilla ISP db, checking for configuration files on the isp's server and guessing. All this will be packed in one user friendly wizard.
