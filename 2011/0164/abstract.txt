My vision is that at the end of this project, a WordPress user will not care at if any time during him/her writing a post on his blog, his Internet connection goes down.Editing files (and posts) on the client and using localStorage to save drafts when the Internet connection goes down can make everyoneâ€™s experience with WordPress a lot more safe and maybe a little more enjoyable.
