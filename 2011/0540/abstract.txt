This Project aims at automating all ADL SCORM 1.2 tests and some ADL SCORM 2004 tests and generating a user friendly HTML report displaying the results of the test. 
The results of the ADL SCORM 2004 tests will be used to find the ADL SCORM 2004 test failures and report bugs and write patches for the same.
