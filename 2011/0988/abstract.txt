Planeshift GUI system is implemented in the PAWS which is mainly based on Crystal Space’s iGraphics2D/iGraphics3D to draw all kinds of widgets. In PAWS, pawsmanager is a singleton to manage the entire GUI library. With the help of pawsMainWidget, pawsmanager could load configurable GUI interface from xml document of in CS’s virtual file system.
The main goal of this proposal is to make Planeshift’s current GUI interface more configurable, more powerful, and user friendly.
