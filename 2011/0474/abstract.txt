The goal of the project is to develop an eclipseâ€™s plug-in lists system installed java libraries for users to select and import into projects. This avoids user manually browses and locates libraries, increasing developing efficiency.  Improved version of Java-config will be used as the data retrieval backend. Jython is used to integrate.This project mainly benefits developers using eclipse, and due to planned work on improving java-config, it will also benefit other non-developer Gentoo users.
