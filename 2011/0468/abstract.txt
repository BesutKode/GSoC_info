The implementation of non-recursive engine in the Tcl interpreter has significantly improved its
performance, however also has caused difficulty in examining internal Tcl call stack, which Gdb is not aware of.
This problem needs to be promptly addressed to ease the interpreter debugging. In this project I would
like to extend Gdb functionality to ease the internal structures investigation.
