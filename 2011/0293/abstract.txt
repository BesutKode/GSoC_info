This document outlines a proposed effort to expand upon the current Haiku USB webcam driver.  It's particular focus is on improving support for high-end (UVC) cameras and exposing their features to applications in Haiku via an extensible API.  Furthermore the project would be developed in such a way that it had a high degree of portability and was thus easily applicable to operating systems besides Haiku.
