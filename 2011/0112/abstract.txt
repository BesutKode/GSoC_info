Tor's long-term viability as a censorship circumvention tools will depend on the ability of the protocol to bypass increasingly sophisticated blocking techniques such as Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). There is a proposal for adding blocking resistance to Tor through pluggable transports. However, how do we know which transport is best? I propose an evaluation framework for testing the effectiveness of transports against various blocking techniques using sample Tor traffic.
