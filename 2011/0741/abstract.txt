This project's target is to reprogram the way tribes behave in PlaneShift.
The end product will feature tribes that will react quickly to outer factors of the world (diplomacy with other tribes/players, expanding, resource managing, etc) and organize themselves based on certain targets.
All tribes will feature unique treats and each tribesman will have different behaviors based on the assignment he gets from the leader.
Besides, an unique mood system will simulate the way tribe members react.
