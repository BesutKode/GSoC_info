Scientists at SETI have their own suite of algorithms to analyse the ATA observation data - however, it is necessary to open this up and port it from a bunch of Matlab/Octave scripts to a unified code standard like C, also improving the code in the process. This new toolkit would be released to the entire web community, permitting users to perform their own analyses and improve the code. They may even submit their own algorithms for incorporation into the toolkit.
