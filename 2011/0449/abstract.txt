Surface models are widely used in robotics for several purposes like object detection, -recognition, -manipulation or simulations. In this project we want to implement robust state-of-the-art textured surface reconstruction methods for a general purpose object recognition and manipulation database for a large number of objects. These methods sit on top of the large number of available algorithms already implemented in PCL.
