The project aims at providing a Graphical Utility for editing xorg.conf.d in a simplified manner so that users do not undergo the pain to modify configuration files. X currently, has automatic configuration but sometimes these configurations have to be manually overriden, in such cases SaX3 can be a useful tool too. The project will be implemented using libYUI to implement its GUI as it provides an interface to ncurses, GTK and Qt.
