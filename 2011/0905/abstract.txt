I propose to create a Django-based custom form creation module that will make it very easy for a non-technical user to create a form, view responses, and perform basic queries on the data. It will be closely integrated with Learning Unlimited's code base, so that forms can be linked to programs and courses, fields can be tied to existing database entries, and individual responses can be tied to users. I will later modify it so that it can be used and extended as a generic form builder.
