GNU Octave is (according to my own experience as user) a very good replacement for proprietary packages like Matlab.  Sometimes it is necessary though to optimize certain regions of code or rewrite them in C++ to get optimal performance.  But currently, there are no profiling tools available (other than simple timing commands), so it can be tedious to find out which areas should be improved.  I want to close that hole by implementing an easy-(and quick)-to-use profiler for Octave.
