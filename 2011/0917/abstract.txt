MINIX 3 is a relatively new operating system, designed to be flexible, reliable and secure. However, the userland in MINIX is limited in terms of scope and functionalities.

In this project, i will expand the MINIX userland by porting the userland utilities from NetBSD and replace the old and obsolete userland part of MINIX with that of NetBSDâ€™s, while minimizing the changes in the NetBSD sources and conforming to newer POSIX revisions.
