This project is about creating a generic logging and reporting solution built upon available Drupal 7 technologies. The main parts are a storage system for raw site-dependent data, a charting solution to provide rich visualizations and finally a reporting system which provides reports about the current and past state of the site. Based upon the provided data a site owner should be able to make data-driven decisions and to hand over well presented reports to other people.
