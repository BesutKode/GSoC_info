Though DiSE provides an interesting new way of analyzing changes between program versions within individual methods, it is important to recognize that methods will often interact. By extending the tool from being just intra-procedural to also being inter-procedural, DiSE will be able to determine the effects that changes have across a broader scope of a program. This will make DiSE's hybrid approach to program verification much more powerful.
