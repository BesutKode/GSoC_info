This project is simply continuation of my GSoC 2010 project. It covers most needed features in EGit Synchronize View that wasn't implemented during last GSoC edition and rest of the year when I as contributing into EGit. By most needed features I mean: improving Synchronization Wizard, fetching changes from remote repository before launching synchronization. synchronization on folder level, update, overwrite and mark as merged context menu actions. refreshing Git Change Set, and so on...
