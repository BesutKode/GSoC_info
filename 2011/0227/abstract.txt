The rationale behind the Coreboot Spice Payload is a software component 
to provide a virtualized desktop to small devices with minimal hardware 
and software resources.

Once the most of the intensive CPU and GPU tasks are moved to the spice 
server it is possible to set poor devices with a full functional desktop 
and minimal software requirements in the client side.
