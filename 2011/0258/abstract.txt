In the following document I propose to implement a first basic support for tables in Scribus. The proposal comes in three parts. First, a problem description where I provide a rationale for the project. Second, an implementation plan including project deliverables and a contingency plan. Third, a tentative timeline for the project, and last some biographical information and other practicalities.
