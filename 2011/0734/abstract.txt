I would like to add a visual testing framework to OGRE.

Traditional unit testing doesn't help much in a context like OGRE, given the sheer size and heavy dependence on graphics API's. The best way of doing tests without needing significant modifications, mock rendersystems or something to that effect, appears to be a visual solution, wherein test screenshots are compared between builds.
