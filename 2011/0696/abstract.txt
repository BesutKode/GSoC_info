Wombat currently runs on Pylons 0.9.7 which is outdated. Porting Wombat to Flask is primarily because Flask is more developer friendly and subsequent updates don't really have lots of changes. Wombat was made to assist artists to work with assets in a repository without having to work with the VCS. Also a 3D assets viewer is required because game development repository has 3D models which have to be downloaded and viewed. Rather than that a preview should be given so that the job becomes easier.
