The goal of this project is to implement a client-server architecture for reporting and querying package statistics of Gentoo based machines. The client program will be used to collect package statistics from Gentoo installations and submit them to a central server. The server will calculate useful statistics based on the global dataset, that developers as well as end users have access to, via an intuitive web interface. I'm looking forward to code the project in Python.
