| Radiomate (Radio Automation Made Easy) is a modular web-radio engine developed for the Google SoC 2010. The work was motivated by the many web radios related to community networking projects. In Rome, for example, the Web radio FusoRadio is present but is currently using proprietary systems. The development of the RadioMate engine is finished, but a complete Web frontend is missing to start using it in a production environment.
