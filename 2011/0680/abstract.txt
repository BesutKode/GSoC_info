At present, users must manually download and move files on their computer to install and update contributed libraries and tools for the PDE. The goal of this project is to ease this process by adding a Library and Tool Manger that will assist users in installing and updating contributions by making use of a simple software repository. In addition, the format in which contributed libraries and tools are packaged will be changed so that they can be distributed more easily.
