The project is an ORM layer for persisting metadata objects in a relational database. We need to handle associations, inheritances and graph structure of metadata objects to achieve it. I am interested in the project because it fits my technical and academic interests. I see a win-win for both the community and myself. I have developed an initial plan, a list of deliverables and a GANTT chart to explain how and when I will accomplish the project. I am excited by the challenge and prospect.
