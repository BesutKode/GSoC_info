The project involves developing interactive time series and longitudinal data plots, in association with a new interactive graphics package for R called cranvas, which is based on Qt, and has the capability to handle large amounts of data.
The purpose is to improve Râ€™s capabilities for exploring temporal data. The time series plot will enable exploring slightly irregular seasonality, and associations between multiple series.The longitudinal plot will enable the study of the individual variation.
