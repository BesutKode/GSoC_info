Getting things Gnome, at present, is a simple task manager, with added multiple backend support for other online and offline apps such as Twitter, RTM, GNote, etc. My project focuses on adding diverse web based backends for different use cases to GTG. Specifically, Iâ€™ll be adding support for Google Calender, Tracks (web based, self hosted GTD application), Github Issues, Bitbucket Issues and Redmine.
