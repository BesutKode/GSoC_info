Using the BSP dependent benchmark timer, and knowing that Tests have no interrupts and only do the activity under test.
I will use the "BSP dependent benchmark timer" to test the Classic API Timing Tests, and POSIX Timing Tests (psxtests) maybe for the last one I will use additional calls like linux clock_gettime().
The reports time measure will be microseconds under sparc/sis simulator.
Basically I've to test each line of pxxtmtests_plan.cvs
