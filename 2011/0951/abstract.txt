Many people want to share files in our mesh network but they step into some problems:
Existent major P2P solutions depend on the Internet ( like emule or torrent )
Most of major existent P2P solutions doesn't support ipv6
Folder sharing like samba doesn't provide efficient file search
People prefer to share depending on relationships, for example you want share some photos with your school companion but not with your headmaster.
