Gentoo has ~15 000 packages only in official tree. Almost each package has a dependencies. Presently, developers of packages specifies them manually. 

I intend to build a tool for generating a list of dependences automatically and  checking a fullness of existing lists.

This tool will be useful for developers of packages and will enable them to make user's experience better.
