This project is about further improving the "Search API" module I created in last year's GSoC and consists of the following smaller tasks:

Add autocompletion feature;
Provide ways to index other data than entities;
Add a "More like this" feature;
Add hierarchical facets for taxonomy terms;
Add additional little multi-language features;
Extend test coverage;
Extend documentation.

The last two are inherently open-ended to use up any time I have left over after the other tasks.
