A key factor for the instructional value of ABM software is the quality and quantity of preloaded demo models, in order to provide new users learning material and "code bases" to build upon. This proposal aims to expand the models library of Repast Simphony to enhance new user instruction and experience. Further development and testing of RepastS is a secondary goal which will accompany the production of demo ABM's.
