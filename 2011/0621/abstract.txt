The goal of this project is to make the Eclipse Rich Ajax Platform more accessible by using WAI-ARIA. 

Since RAP applications run in a web browser, they do not provide the same level of accessibility as RCP clients do.

ARIA can be utilized to enhance RAP widgets with additional information that can be exposed to assistive technology (like screen readers).
