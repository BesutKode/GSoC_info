The main goal of the project would be to write an OpenACS package for generating W3C widget standard conformant content packages out of learning materials that reside within the dotLRN system. As a starting point, generic code for generating such content packages out of OpenACS content repository items should be implemented. Further steps could involve other widget formats or the packaging of Wiki-based content/applications into widgets.
