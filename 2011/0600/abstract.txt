Dual quaternion skinning is a method of skinning that addresses commonly associated problems with linear blend skinning. By using an approximate blending method, dual quaternion skinning is able to achieve comparable speeds to linear blend skinning, while still retaining the increase in visual quality. This project will cause Ogre to support dual quaternion skinning seamlessly for the user, including InstanceManager support.
