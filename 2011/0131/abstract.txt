Educators are given many tools to assist in teaching today's youth. However, 
some of these tools are very expensive, difficult to use, or are not easily 
accessible. This project would create an open-source solution to aid in 
connecting teachers at multiple levels by sharing quiz data and providing a 
consistent game interface for asessing students.
