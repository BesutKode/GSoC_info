Using 3D perception sensors as stereo camera or laser scanner, the perceived environment and objects are described by many sets of +3D points called Point Clouds (PC). Moving the sensor, the returned PCs overlap more or less. The goal is to align (register) the acquired PCs in order to get a more complete description of the environment. This project aims to implement and improve already existing state of the art methods used for PCs registration and using acquired experience propose a new method
