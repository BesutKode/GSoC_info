Dimensionality reduction is the process of finding a suitable low-dimensional dataset from
high-dimensional one by reducing its dimensionality. One of the most important practical
issues of applied machine learning, it is widely used for preprocessing real data. Its importance
is deriving from challenges presented by high-dimensional spaces, performance and other issues. Being large-scale, SHOGUN is missing preprocessors for dim. reduction and this project aims for implementation some of them.
