Debugging a metacircular JVM brings a number of challenges. Such a runtime lies in the wilderness between a native JVM (with debugging tools like gdb) and a Java application (with jdb or visual debuggers). This project will firstly implement the JVM Tools Interface (JVMTI) enabling developers some lower level access to JVM internals. It will then implement other useful tools for debugging the runtime itself, such as the Maxine Inspector or extensions to gdb.
