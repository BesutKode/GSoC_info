This project proposes to develop an open source framework bridging existing social media, machine learning, analytic modeling, and natural language processing libraries.  The prototype application that this project will develop to demonstrate the framework's usefulness will be a program that monitors Twitter feeds to predict breaking news stories before news organizations report on them.
