My proposal is to build a better and easier class of Semantic Query UI's for the Semantic MediaWiki extension, by splitting the Semantic Search page into two modules. The former will work as the UI for Special:Ask (with better usability and auto-complete than its current avatar). The latter would run underneath this UI and also serve as an interface to easily build other query generation and data exploration user interfaces (such as interactive graphs) created by others in the future.
