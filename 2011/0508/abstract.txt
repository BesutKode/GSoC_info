Crystal Space now uses OPCODE as collision system; uses Bullet/ODE as physical system. The collision part of Bullet can be used in Crystal Space as an alternative of OPCODE. The functionalities of collision system and physical system in CS need to be unified. So I will clean the API of the two parts. Besides, there are some useful features of Bullet which havenâ€™t been implemented in CS. I will add these features to CS then make some improvement, like portal, explosion, character controller, etc.
