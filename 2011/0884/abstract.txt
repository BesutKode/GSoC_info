I propose to implement and integrate three of the leading algorithms published in VisWeek, 2010 to the VTK framework. The first algorithm is an optimization-based axis-labelling technique that optimizes the format, font, size, and orientation of the axis-labels.  The second is a cell location technique that can be used as an improved alternative to the existing techniques available in VTK.  Thirdly, I plan to implement a 3D-vector-field rendering technique to represent stream surfaces.
