This projectâ€™ goal is to make RTEMS support virtualization which allow other OS like linux coexist with RTEMS under the same underlying system hardware. There is already a project named AIR which have implement a Hypervisor and a paravirtualized RTEMS. So the main work of this project is to paravirtualize the linux to AIR Hypervisor and integrate it with AIR to realize virtualization.
