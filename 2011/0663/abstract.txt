Complex 3D objects are usually represented using tetrahedral meshes. Delaunay triangulation scheme could be used to build such meshes but their "quality" is critical for different numerical algorithms (e.g. the finite element method). Therefore the mesh is usually improved by different local transformations over the vertices and edges. Our goal is to implement some of them (edge removal, edge collapse, multi-face removal) in a reliable manner.
