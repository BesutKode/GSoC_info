This project is intended to implement a pastebin link to messages. When clicked, users can enter text or upload files. This data will be processed and sent to the pastebin servers to create a new file. From there, the url of the resulting page will be given back to the user and automatically inserted into their message. This will bypass character limits and allow people to quickly post code.
