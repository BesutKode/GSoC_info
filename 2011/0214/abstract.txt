The project aims to improvise the present syntax available for the purpose of making it more familiar and easier to use. Presently the idea is to generate a stand-alone lex/yacc based program using PLY as compiler tool. The program reads from the input file of new-syntax models and generates ascend 4 compatible models. The new syntax will act as a wrapper over the present syntax and no changes in the TypeDescription or Instantiation stages will be required.
