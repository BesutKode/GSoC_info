Geoserver (www.geoserver.org)  authentication is based on Spring Security and offering a user id / password log in. After a successful log in process, the user has some predefined roles. Based on these roles, authorization takes place.
Spring Security offers many additional authentication mechanisms. (Http Basic, Http Digest, X.509 Certificate, openID, ...). Based on these mechanisms a more powerful Geoserver authentication architecture should be developed.
