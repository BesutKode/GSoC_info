This project aims at transforming the default KDE Plasmoids which are currently in C++ (using QGraphicsView) to QML/Javascript. This would open the doors to better visual appearance and interaction with the plasmoids. Since QML is a declarative language, the UI can be written with very less code, reducing the maintenance costs. QML is primarily aimed at mobile devices so the QML plasmoids may easily be adopted to mobile devices too. The QML plasmoids would also load faster reducing startup time.
