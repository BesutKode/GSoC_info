The goal is to Implement H.264 MVC stereo high profile encoder for x264 encoder. This will enable x264 to author 3D blu-ray discs. The initial approach will be to implement SHP 
without interlaced content and constant QP and once the initial skeleton is up, then the rate control will be added followed by interlaced content.
