I am interested on  "Graph based Cassandra Partitioner" project under "Globus Online" topic, since it fits best to my interests. Currently, I am working at High Performance Computing Lab at BMI Department as a research assistant (bmi.osu.edu/hpc) where I do research on parallel graph algorithms and graph coloring problem. I summarized existing graph partitioning algorithms in the proposal and suggested a reasonable timeline. I have contacted to Tom Howe (mentor) and got a positive feedback.
