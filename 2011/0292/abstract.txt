The success of any open source project depends mainly on two factors. First, it is just how well it is written and here I refer to the fact just how fast and usable it is. The second factor is how easy it is to use it. It is pointless to create a state of art solution to something if no one else understands it how and when to use it. Through my project I intend to improve this later on of the OpenCV by writing multiple quality source code examples accompanied by in-depth tutorials for them.
