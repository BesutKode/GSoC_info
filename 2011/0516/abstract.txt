In GRASS GIS new modules suitable for hydrological analysis have been developed, r.stream*. My idea is to develop a wxpython GUI  for r.stream* that allows to see the preview of the hydrological analysis over a part of a map and then decide if apply the analysis or not. It will include "multiple previews". Every result can be saved as an image and set of parameters for future use in additional "preview windows", next choose from group of possible parameters that which is most suitable.
