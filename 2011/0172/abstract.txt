Commercial packages like REFPROP act as a
databases of fluid properties, in fact they are actually programs which use thermodynamic equations of state to calculate these properties on the fly.
The purpose of this project is to develop
the open source FPROPS platform which seeks to emulate and expand upon these programs.
Specifically FPROPS will be restructured for extensibility, existing discrepancies will be
investigated and new features such as support for new equations of state will be added.
