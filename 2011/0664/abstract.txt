The aim of this project is to create a port of a FRESCOR (www.frescor.org) resource reservation framework for RTEMS. It will provide with a convenient real-time application design for distributed systems making use of CORBA protocol. The framework is currently running under Linux. It is necessary to refactor it into a single address space, prepare an appropriate scheduling (EDF) with a budget handling in order to provide a temporal isolation of tasks and fit the API between FRESCOR and RTEMS.
