The project goal is to implement RPS/RFS on FreeBSD. Highend NICs have multiple receive queues and implemented the feature called RSS, which can distribute packets across multiple processors. However, typical cheap mono-queue NICs doesn't have such ability. RPS soluve the problem by emulating RSS behavior on mono-queue NICs. RFS is the extension of RPS, which deliver packets to the CPU where application running. RPS/RFS are produced for Linux, the project will implement these behavor on FreeBSD.
