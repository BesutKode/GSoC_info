NetBSD and pkgsrc already provide the building blocks for cross-compiling packages. The purpose of this project is to connect the dots, making it easier to deploy an environment for cross-building packages. It should be as straightforward as installing cross/pgksrc-amd64-to-vax, in order to be able to build vax packages on an amd64 host. We will deal only with packages that already allow cross-compilation (i.e., we will no try to fix those that don't).
