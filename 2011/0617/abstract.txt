DEX is a new program designed to help improve Debian and its derivatives by merging in changes made downstream and encouraging discussions between the various projects. As this is a new project, most of the infrastructure does not exist (or is rather hackish and incomplete). This project would involve working closely with the members of the DEX team to create the necessary backend tools so that all Debian derivatives can easily make use of the DEX project.
