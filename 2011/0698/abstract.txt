Build a tool that allows user to perform basic image processing operations on images in a webpage. It would use Fluid Infusion and HTML5. In addition to this, it would also allow the user to perform the operations using keyboard instead of mouse. The tool would allow operations to resize, crop and tag an image. In addition to this, if time permits, I would also like to add other operations like rotation and transformations on the image.
