Appliances built with Suse Studio can be thought of as any other software project that has to be built, tested and deployed. Currently appliances have to be built using the web-interface, which while being
full-featured might be a little clunky if extensive configuration, through multiple overlay files and packages, is required. The goal of this project is to create a command line tool(ssc) to make it easy for
users to create appliances locally and deploy them.
