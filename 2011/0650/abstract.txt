This project will attempt to produce a version of the Cytoscape Web program using only JavaScript and HTML5. This version will no longer use Adobe Flash which is the core of the current Cytoscape Web program. This change will attempt to increase the portability of Cytoscape Web (since operating systems such as iOS do not support Adobe Flash) and explore the feasibility of a Cytoscape Web that only uses web standards. The time-efficiency of HTML5 versus Adobe Flash will also be explored.
