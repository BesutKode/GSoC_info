DIM SUM is a recently released simulator of phylogeographic histories based on the movement and reproduction of individuals on a continuous landscape. While very general and flexible, the current implementation of DIM SUM can be quite slow as the number of individuals increases or the resolution of the landscape becomes more refined. The goal of this project is to improve the speed of the simulation by using the GPU for the time consuming computations.
