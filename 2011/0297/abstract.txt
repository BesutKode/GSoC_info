The goal of this project is to produce the necessary language extensions to facilitate programming of high-performance computing (HPC) applications in Tcl, and to better take advantage of modern hardware. In particular this project delivers:
 * A Tcl binding to HWloc using the TEA build system.
 * Comprehensive testing and examples.
 * Documentation.
 * Proper hosting.
