Apache Xerces2 is a high-performance, standard complaint processor written in Java for parsing, validating, serializing and manipulating XML documents.  And xml:id provides a formal convention for attributes expressing unique identifiers for elements in XML documents. The objective of this project is to provide xml:id support to the Xerces2 by implementing a xml:id processing module.
