I've decided to take up Orbot and ORLib and improve upon them. Orbot requires extensive UI/UX work to make the interface more simple and intuitive. Additional features such as implementing the TorCheck API , and data statistics need to be added to Orbot. ORLib is very minimal at the moment, with very less features and documentation. More features need to be built into ORLib and also an example app should be made as a sort of primer for other third party apps to follow.
