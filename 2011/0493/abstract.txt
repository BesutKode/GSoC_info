VirtIO is a generic paravirtualized mainly used in KVM now. But it should not be too hard to port VirtIO to Xen. When done, Xen will have access to Linux kernel's VirtIO interfaces and developers will have an alternative way to deliver PV drivers besides from the original ring buffer flavor. This project requires: Modify upstream QEMU, replace KVM-specified interface with generic QEMU function; Modify Xen / Xentools to support VirtIO; Modify Linux kernel's VirtIO interfaces.
