This proposal describes a new Parrot debugger. It will include features such as setting breakpoints, setting watchpoints on registers or individual PMC's, stepping through code both forwards and backwards, backtrace, etc. Additionally, it will provide code instrumentation and be able to introspect state information from running code. The debugger will read debug information and annotations so that it can be used to work with all Parrot-supported HLL's at either the PIR or HLL level.
