Enhance Blender’s weight painting tools:
1) A bone’s weights will become lockable so that the relative ratios will remain unchanged during painting,
2) Multiple bones will be selectable so that the ratios of the weights of the selected vertex groups will remain relatively the same,
3) The automatic weighting system will be extended to post-process selected regions to avoid manual fine-tuning
