An initial contribution to Assignment Management: Consists of creation of a new "Java Assignment" entity (to support all actions related to Assignment Management), a drag-drop facility to make it easy for a student to import an assignment from an HTML page and also a facility for a student to chat with his TA from Eclipse.

This initial contribution seeks to introduce to Eclipse IDE for Education, the concept of assignment management, keeping in mind the addition of more features in the future.
