CernVM-FS is a network filesystem developed to provide read-only access to remote HTTP servers. These servers organize file data in content addressable storage, and are mirrored globally. CernVM-FS clients may choose one nearest mirror to reduce latency. This project aims to provide an orchestrating service that instructs consistent snapshot replication among mirrors. An enhancement to the current cvmfs_pull is also proposed to allow mirrors to pull data from others in a peer-to-peer fashion.
