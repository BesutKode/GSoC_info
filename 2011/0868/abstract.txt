One of the current drawbacks of the LLVM JIT is the lack of an adaptive compilation System. All the non-adaptive bits are already there in LLVM: optimizing compiler with the different types of instruction selectors, register allocators, preRA schedulers, etc. and a full set of optimizations changeable at runtime. What's left is a system that can keep track of and dynamically look-up the hotness of methods and re-compile with more expensive optimizations as the methods are executed over and over.
