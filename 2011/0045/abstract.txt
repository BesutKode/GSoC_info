This project aims to provide a tool for visualizing data in a relational table as a scatter plot along any two of its columns. For example, each movie in a movies table can be represented in a scatter plot with popularity and release year acting as the X and Y axis. A user can also drill down(zoom) to have a closer look at certain portions of the plot and get any details about the data on demand. It will provide a powerful means to interpret, explore and communicate data/information.
