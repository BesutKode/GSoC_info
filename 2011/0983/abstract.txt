The goal of this idea is to separate tasks of plugin developers, core contributors and translators, automating more tasks. This task should be divided in two separate projects. The first is in the GlotPress side, which is the bridge between plugin repository and GlotPress. The second is in the plugin side. The bridge is in the responsibility of WordPress.org team and the plugin project is in my responsibility.
