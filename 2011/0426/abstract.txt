The project aims at providing the “fastest and most scalable” implementations of three modern nonparametric predictive methods (SpAM, MT-SpAM and G-SpAM). This package has the potential to become a general-purpose exploratory data analysis toolbox for a wide range of data analysis practitioners. The targeted applications include large-scale scientific data analysis (e.g. genomics/proteomics/bio-imaging), social media data analysis (e.g. image/audio/video/text modeling) and financial time-series
