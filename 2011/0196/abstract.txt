GObject property binding (GBinding) is a very useful tool for GTK+ application development as it allows the definition of several kinds of basic interactions between UI widgets in a clean, declarative manner. In order to expose this relatively unknown feature to developers and make its use as convenient as possible, this project aims to extend Glade with an easy-to-use interface for creating and editing property bindings as well as saving them as part of GtkBuilder files.
