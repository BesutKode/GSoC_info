The main goals of the project are to transition Sunlight's iPhone app to an iOS native application, reach feature parity with the Android app and desktop web app, and introduce new features to enhance the user's experience. Potential new features include live streaming, push notifications, an iPad oriented app, bookmarking/highlighting, autolinking of key terms and visualizations such as maps.
