Sakai has a powerful RESTful interface called EntityBroker, which has the ability to expose data in Sakai as XML and JSON. This project is to develop a mobile application for Sakai, using PhoneGap, so that it runs on a variety of platforms (iOS and Android in the first instance). The application will consume the data available via EntityBroker to render its views and perform its functions. As discussed up to now app. will be fully written in javascript and HTML.
