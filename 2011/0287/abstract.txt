GeoGebra is translated into more than fifty languages and those translations are organized manually at the moment, taking away much time from the developers. The target of this project is to create new or modify existing online translation tools to simplify the translation process, making it more easy and less time consuming for both translators and developers. While this project is intended to help GeoGebra's development its outcome could be beneficial for other open source projects as well.
