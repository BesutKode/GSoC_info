The aim of the project is to add an extensive range of unit and functional tests for the logic and views of the SoC framework. Lack of sufficient number of tests for existing code is hindering the rapid development and delaying the adoption of a Test Driven Development by Melange. We aim to write a suite of tests which will enable developers to test their modified code on their machine itself prior to submitting it for review.
