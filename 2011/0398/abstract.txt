This proposal outlines a summer project to finish the initial implementation of the PTX back-end within LLVM.  The motivation for such a back-end is given, along with a concrete implementation plan, by a developer that is already familiar with, and has submitted contributions to, the current PTX back-end.  This project would extend the range of influence of LLVM and let it enter the GPU compiler field with fully open-source code.
