The main effort of the project is the development of a graphical user interface for the GeoGebra to Javascript port (GeoGebraMobile) using GWT. Development will be centered around existing components (GGJsViewer) and expand them. The user interface should capture the look and feel of the original Java application (Desktop/Web Start) where possible and reasonable. The ultimate goal is to create a functioning prototype which provides a small subset of features found in the original application.
