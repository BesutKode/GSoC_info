My proposal include:

1) Better error handling (not just interrupt tranfer because of any error).
2) Intelligently adding tasks to queue instead of running them instantly (this will highly increase transfer speed when a lot of tasks started).
3) Transferring files and scanning directory in parallel (users will save their time)
