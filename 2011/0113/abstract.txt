In this project the library search functionality of the Mixxx software will be upgraded. As described in the original proposal, the indexing of the items (songs) in the library will be implemented allowing for faster search. There will be more searchable meta-data, such as bpm, key etc. Additional operators will allow for adding more control to the search instead of just matching text. An additional feature will be the context operator allowing for a search based on the currently playing tracks.
