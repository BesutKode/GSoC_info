KDE has many really great parts. And this project aims at tighter integration of three of them - PIM, Nepomuk and Telepathy. The idea is to bring Nepomuk's PIMO:Person into PIM and then make use of it by integrating IM capabilities throughout PIM with the KDE-Telepathy project. Conversly, KDE-Telepathy will then gain emailing and other PIM features. All this can later be a showcase of truly integrated, social and semantic desktop.
