The project consists in building a set of themeable interactive widgets for PySoy. The main goal is to build some widget like containers, collapsible branches, text input/display and scrollable panels to make possible to build a buddy list and chat widgets in PySoy, which users will use to comunicate in and out PySoy's based games.
An example using these themeable widgets will be produced as well as several unit tests.
