I propose to implement a replacement for the gentoo.org web pages, that include the documentation, project, news and other informational pages, via a Django CMS. Additional Django/Python plugins will be used, e.g. for LDAP integration. The Beacon editor, a former GSOC project, will also be adapted to the project as a WYSIWYG editor for the Gentoo-specific XML schemas. Various features that will improve the documentation handling are going to be implemented.
