Lucene contrib query parser has a configuration API that was inherited from token stream API, which uses AttributeSource and Attributes to share token information across token filters. However, the use of this Attribute API in contrib query parser makes configuration much more complex than it needs to be. This project proposes to simplify this API to something much simpler, using a map data structure instead of the complex Attribute API.
