When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, the levees failed to protect the city. There's now an initiative to improve the monitoring systems for them.

This system would then alert the proper authorities through a variety of different means. For guidance on how to design such a system, seek out information on best practices for safety monitoring systems.
