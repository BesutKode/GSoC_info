I am Eranda Sooriyabandara, student of Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. 
Apache Tuscany provides a comprehensive infrastructure to simplify the task of developing and managing Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) solutions based on Service Component Architecture (SCA) standard.
In this project my ultimate goal is to create a SCA portable data store component/s over number of 'NoSQL' databases like Apache Cassandra, and CouchDB.
