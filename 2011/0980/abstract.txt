My proposal is about extending Freemail to support the web of trust plugin in order to provide spam resistant and anonymous messaging. By reusing most of the design from Freemail it should be hard for others to know not only the content of messages, but also that someone are communicating. The web of trust plugin provides the foundation for both spam resistance and relatively easy integration with the rest of the Freenet ecosystem.
