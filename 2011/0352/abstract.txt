It's valuable to replace existing logic in the Derby test harness with JUnit code and to fix existing bugs. With the new JUnit tests, Derby would gain all the benefits of JUnit, such as running tests from ant, integration with IDEs, ability to hook into other JUnit suites, easier understanding of how Derby tests are run etc. 

I will focus on 'Make testcases pass in non-English locale', 'Convert remaining store SQL tests into JUnit tests' and 'Converting ij[1-4].sqls to ScripTestCase'.
