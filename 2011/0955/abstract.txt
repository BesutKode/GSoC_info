Swiftscript is a parallel scripting language that allows large datasets to be processed over a distributed system easily. 

This project focusses on two areas, Associative arrays and Map-Reduce. Swiftscript currently supports simple arrays accessed by an index. This project extends Swiftscript by introducing associative arrays to the language. We extend the language to support the use of types such as string, boolean and compound types as subscripts. Using the associative arrays we add language support for Map-Reduce style functions.
