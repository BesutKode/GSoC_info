This project aims to add support for CUnit test format to API Sanity 
Autotest tool. The tool currently supports only Template2Code format which is quite
complicated and is not very popular. A support for other test 
formats like CUnit (which is the most popular nowadays) is neaded to
extend the API SanityAutotest framework audience.
