I would like to convert the existing xhp-helpfiles to wikisyntax using an existing script. I will create a program making helpfiles from the wikisyntax dynamically. These helpfiles shall be displayed on GNU, OSX and Windows running native software. With the use of my program every user will be able to read a fresh version of the LibreOffice help in the beauty of the graphical user interface of his or her chosen platform.
