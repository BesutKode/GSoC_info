tagin! is an open source, location tagging engine that may be used to create indoor, location-based services and applications. The initial goal of the project is to create a mobile engine that characterizes the distinct patterns of radio-frequency activity in a particular place and assigns a unique identifier or URN to each one. The second phase of the project intends to develop a demo application to showcase the potential of tagin! engine.
