I would be extremely interested in joining the development of Repast Simphony in Project #1: Create Agent Based Model "Demos" using Repast Symphony during GSoC 2011.

I am a PhD student, and my research activities and work focuses on various aspects and applications of Agent-Based Simulations.

This is an outstanding possibility I would really like to attend to.
