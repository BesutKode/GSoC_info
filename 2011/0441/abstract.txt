The “Conversion modules between game representations” project will include the development of utilities to convert between the .xml and .efg file formats.  These file types are used by different modules within the Gambit toolset to store extensive form game information.  The conversion utilities will allow for comparison of algorithms implemented by different modules within the Gambit toolset.
