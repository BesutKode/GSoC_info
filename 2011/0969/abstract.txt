KDE is unique in the Linux eco-system for providing support for alternative calendar systems, such as the Hebrew, Islamic Civil, and Japanese calendar systems. However, KDE does not as yet support calendar systems that require astronomical calculations, such as the Chinese, Hindu and Islamic Lunar calendars. This proposal aims at proposing a model to implement support for astronomical calculations in different calendar systems and other KDE libraries and applications.
