EPreferences project is an Eclipse plugin that aims at creating comprehensive preferences mechanism for the Eclipse 4 without the faults of its predecessors. Special focus is set on introducing better import / export handling with preferences grouped into a tree-like structure, as well as proper preferences validation and preferences discovery mechanism. To facilitate setting default values and groups for preferences a visual editor will be created.
