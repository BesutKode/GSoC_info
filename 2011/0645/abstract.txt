In wireless mesh networks handling broadcast packets in an efficient way is still an open problem. The ARP-REQ is a packet sent in broadcast and it is stricly needed to establish a IP stream between two hosts. In case of packet loss it will obviously increase the initial connection delay. In a layer 2 mesh DAT wants to optimise the ARP-REQ/REP procedure to avoid the use of broadcast communications as much as possible and rely on the much efficient unicast ones mixing mesh and DHT
