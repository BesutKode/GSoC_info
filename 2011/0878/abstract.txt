The goal of this project is to implement a new string representation for Python to reduce the memory footprint produced by Unicode strings.  During this project, I will implement the design outlined in PEP 393 and port critical parts of core Python and the standard library to the new API.  I will also profile the memory reduction and speed penalty of my implementation with specific micro-benchmarks and Django example applications to validate that the PEP provides the promised gains.
