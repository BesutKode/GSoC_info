Currently we have NOPSA database and its API. We want to increase its usage so that relevancy scores can be streamlined. This can be achieved by developing a Microsoft Office add-in. I also propose to extend current NOPSA DB & API so that useful crowd-scored generated information can be stored back to the server, hence increasing quality of relevancy score with each image. Moreover, I also propose to add new CC image sources.
