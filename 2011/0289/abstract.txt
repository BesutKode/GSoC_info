Geosocial services like Foursquare and Gowalla let users enjoy Location-based social networking. But they are centralized and closed-source, this project aims to implement a similar but federated location-based game platform on top of StatusNet in the spirit of Federated Social Web. This will add one more *awesome* use case for StatusNet and help expand the user base (in its own humble way), hence adding value to the global OStatus network.
