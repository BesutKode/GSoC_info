For generating a mesh, Netgen currently has 2 types of input for the 3D solids, i.e. an input described by the Constructive Solid Geometries and one by the standard STL file format. As for the 2D objects, the only type of input is the one which uses spline curves. The aim of this project is to use the similar approach of the CSG input format in the case of 2D shapes. As a consequence, the time consumed to setup the 2D geometries needed for the simulation over 2D figures will be diminished.
