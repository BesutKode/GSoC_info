We want to build a bndtools based OSGi bunlles maker project, it will help us analyse java application and split the whole project into several OSGi bundles.This tool can analyse source code, supply vari-size grained split and refactor suggestions, show the analyse result in a GUI view and we can change split solution manually, then it will split the project into several OSGi bundles/projects.
