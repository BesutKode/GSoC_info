Extend 'git cherry-pick' with '--continue', '--abort', and '--skip'
features.  This will ultimately be used to write git-sequencer, a new
builtin command.  The sequencer will provide a uniform interface over
which existing commands like 'rebase', 'rebase -i' and 'am' can be
re-implented.  This should give the commands more functionality,
improve their error handling, and make them faster.  The project can
only be considered successful if most of the code written gets merged
into upstream.
