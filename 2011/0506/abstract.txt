With this work I plan to: convert the sound related part of the code into a plug-in; improve the support for factory based sounds; create support for random sounds from both environment and monsters; solve the problem associated to stacking of sounds implementing a distance lag effect; support for weapon and attack based sounds; introduction of musical instruments and composing activity in the game.
