The purpose of the project is to develop an OpenMRS module to maintain personnel information and generate reports useful at the clinical level and compatible with a national personnel system. The design is based on iHRIS (an open source personnel management and qualifications system written in PHP), but is integrated with the new OpenMRS provider model. (Additional or modified requirements may come from other international projects currently underway.)
