The best thing about NetBSD is that it ships with a lot of useful and helpful documentation which should obviate the need for looking for any outside help.

In the age of Google, it seems necessary to rethink this.

This project aims to develop a replacement for apropos that provides full text search capabilities using the FTS engine of sqlite3.
