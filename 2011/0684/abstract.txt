Lua Memory Profiler will be a library for the Lua language that collects
information about the memory of a program throughout its execution.
The program memory profile using this library will be shown graphically in
real time, detailing the different data types being allocated, reallocated or
released. Our library will also provide other useful information, such as
maximum memory allocated and maximum number of allocated objects.
