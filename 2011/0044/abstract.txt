The project aims at design of an automatic tuning framework for GridFTP, the primary  protocol used within Globus Online for performing bulk data transfers. It involves collecting and analysing data about how round trip time and packet loss rate varies with number of threads used for a TCP connection. Basing on the data, a decision framework shall be implemented. The decision framework will be used to determine optimum thread level in GridFTP.
