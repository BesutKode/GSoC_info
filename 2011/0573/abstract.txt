Recent changes in the Python interpreter ecosystem made it obvious that the Jinja2 templating engine took a too naive approach to template compilation to excel on JIT interpreted Python versions.

On top of that changes in Python itself in regards to AST compilation make new things possible without falling back to hacks as Jinja2 currently does.

Because Django's template engine internally has some performance problems I propose writing a new template engine backend for Jinja2 and Django.
