KWin is one of the oldest parts of the KDE Plasma Workspaces. During the last twelve years its development focus has undergone a change from a pure X11 window manager to an OpenGL compositor. For the future another important development is emering: X11 will be replaced by Wayland. To make KWin ready for the port to Wayland, its code stack has to be prepared. Not all parts of KWin will make sense in a Wayland environment. Therefore KWin has to be refactored to ease the reusablility of code.
