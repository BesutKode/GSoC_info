java.util.concurrent contains many classes including native methods. The jpf-concurrent project supports many of these classes by using model classes and native peer classes. A part of java.util.concurrent is java.util.concurrent.atomic which can be used to implement lock-free algorithms. This project includes providing support for unhandled native calls within java.util.concurrent. Moreover, regression tests will be performed to ensure the compatibility of this package with jpf-concurrent.
