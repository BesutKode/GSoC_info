This project aims at extending the pgRouting library to support time-dependent shortest path routing where the edge weights are function of time and other parameters. Unlike static scenario, where the edge weights do not change here, we assume that the weights change according to time. So, while traversing any edge, the algorithm must consider the cost of edge at that instant of time. Thus the algorithm will give the path which has least arrival time from source to destination.
