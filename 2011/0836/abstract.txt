Gallium3D can be used to implement many client APIs on top of hardware- or software-accelerated pipe drivers.

This proposal is about implementing the OpenCL API on top of Gallium 3D, to enable user to enjoy GPU-accelerated computing using Free Software technologies and no proprietary drivers or pieces of code.

The project will be built on the Clover branch of Mesa, and will use Clang as the compiler.
