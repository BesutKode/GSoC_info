The goal of the project is to implement an architecture independent API and structure to manage memory blocks with access attributes based on MMU Support. The API should provide a mechanism for memory protection based on MMU hardware and a low-level MMU support carried out for PowerPC PSIM board in GSOC2009. Users can use the API to manage an access lookup table, called MMU context. Using the API, RTEMS Objects such as Region can manage memory blocks with access right control ability.
