For the GSoC 2011 I propose to finalize the odeint library currently developed in the boost sandbox by my colleague Karsten Ahnert and myself. The library already has, after several re-designs, reached a quite sophisticating level, we believe. However, our goal is to eventually be ready for a boost review process. So in a possible GSoC project I will try to further improve odeint with the help of an experienced library author. My aim is to finalize odeint for a boost review.
