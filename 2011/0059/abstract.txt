The UI for existing features could be more user-friendly. e.g. a dashboard-kind of an interface. This would lead to quick blogging on the go and remove unnecessary steps while performing basic operations like posting a new post, pictures and videos. Removing the current tab-kind of an interface and bringing in a grid interface like the current Twitter and Facebook app. The UX would also have to be improved. This means large buttons, easy to browse-interface and smooth graphic flows too.
