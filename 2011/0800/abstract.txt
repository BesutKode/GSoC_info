A hot backup, also called a dynamic backup, is a backup performed on data even though it is actively accessible to users and may currently be in a state of being updated. Snapshots is one of the desirable features at the file system level, with Btrfs already having it and Ext4 snapshots project is already under way.https://github.com/amir73il/ext4-snapshots. Ext4 Snapshots can be effectively leveraged to implement hot File System Backup on another device.
