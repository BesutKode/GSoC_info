Mono Debugger is a part of MonoDevelop that provides debugging support to the developers. A Debugger Visualizer is defined as a component that facilitates the debugger to display the contents of a data type in a meaningful way. This extends the debuggerâ€™s capability to handle .NET data types or custom data types and to identify any wrong or missing value(s). As part of Google Summer of Code (GSoC), this project proposal aims to develop debugger visualizers for the Mono Debugger.
