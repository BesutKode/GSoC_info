SymPy currently uses Gr√∂bner bases for -- among other things -- computations in polynomial rings, computing minimal polynomials of algebraic numbers and solving systems of polynomial equations. I plan to implement the F5B flavor of the F5 algorithm in order to improve performance with such computations and allow for new applications, such as simplification of rational functions modulo prime ideals.
