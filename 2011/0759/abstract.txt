„Kexi is an integrated data management application” as project main page says, in human speech it is database tool which can be used by average Joe without extensive knowledge about programming. Project target is to create sets of plugins for viewing geographical data, beginning from Kexi and ending on every Calligra Suite program that can use flake shapes. Second part of project would be technical blog describing progress and internals of Kexi and Calligra, what may be very helpful for others.
