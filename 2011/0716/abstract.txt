DuraCloud currently supports Amazon S3, Rackspace CloudFiles and Windows Azure as storage providers. The Eucalyptus Private Cloud software provides an S3 interface to access it's 'Walrus' storage. The primary goal of the project is to develop and document the Walrus storage adapter, using a generic S3ApiProvider design, thus proving out the integration of DuraCloud with Eucalyptus Private Cloud. It requires creating a new storage provider for DuraCloud to enable this integration.
