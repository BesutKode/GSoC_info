Kiten is a great tool for japanese language students as it provides you an interface for dictionaries and radical selector. This project goal is to resurrect Kiten as its GUI and most of its code has not been maintained in a very long time, it should benefit from new KDE features as well as update the dictionaries, increase support and improve the user experience. As a heavy user of this amazing software it would be a shame if it disappears because of lack of maintenance/features.
