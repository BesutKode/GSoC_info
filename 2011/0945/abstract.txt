In the context of VoIP communication, a codec is a device capable of processing data beforehand so that it will be in a form suitable for transmission through the Internet.  As available bandwidth around increases, the major concern of VoIP developers has shifted from using less bandwidth to supporting better quality.
This project is about to implement in Jitsi support for wideband audio codecs. Two wideband codecs, SILK and Opus, will be implemented in this project.
