I'd like to contribute to Code for America this summer by working on the Government Gems & Eggs project. I feel my background of contributing to open-source and knowledge of several open-source technologies would allow me to offer something tangible. I've previously worked with several open government data sources in my personal projects, so I'm aware of the difference between properly documented and well-tested APIs versus sloppy, undocumented code.
