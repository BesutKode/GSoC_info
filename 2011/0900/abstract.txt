The web is becoming more social and adding social features to Apache PhotArk would be ideal to cater for users who require such features and make the application more popular. The goal of this project is to build a back-end API in PhotArk to support for social features conforming to  the OpenSocial specification, providing user interface components to enable social features and integrating OpenSocial API using reference implementations like Apache Shindig.
