Zencat is a GUI to Ncat, the Nmap equivalent of the popular swiss army knife of network tools, netcat. The purpose of Zencat is to facilitate raw human interaction(either manual or semi-automatic) with network sockets by building an extended usability layer above the Ncat backend. Zencat will enable for usability cases to be built on top of Ncat that arenâ€™t possible or comfortable for the command line version of this tool.
