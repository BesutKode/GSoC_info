Adding Network Sync support to the open source 3D graphics engine Irrlicht for use with the liquid-galaxy project. 

This involves synchronizing a game state across multiple computers in real time (at least 30 times a second) to produce a seamless gaming experience on a liquid galaxy computer. With the hundreds of applications currently developed with Irrlicht and its ease of use it is a perfect engine to support the liquid galaxy experience with potential for some really cool apps down the line
