The YUI library is a library that gives the programmer the ability to have his program use 3 GUI's or front ends with a single code. It acts as an abstraction layer to Qt, GTK as well as ncurses libraries. But, as of now, it is restricted to SUSE based operating systems because of it's excessive dependance on YaST infrastructure. The main aim of this project is to extract, package and port libYUI to other operating systems so that it can be used by a larger number of people.
