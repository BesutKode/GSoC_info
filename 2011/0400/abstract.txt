This proposal has two goals: 1. Migrate CCV from openframeworks; 2. Make a new wxWidgets based frameworks with module structure. CCV has a huge number of users, however, it is weak in GUI. CCV is based on openframeworks, which just simulates a GUI, instead of use operation systemâ€™s native GUI API. Once CCV was migrated, a new frameworks based on wxWidgets will be extracted and be the general frameworks for all our Community Core Services.
