Saving energy on ad-hoc network gets special interest from current research. Network interfaces need an appropriate wake/sleep time to both fully operate and remain sleeping long enough to keep energy. A modified protocol is suggested in which the ATIM is first supported by MAC 802.11 drivers, and then could be changed adaptively based on the network condition such as traffic or noise.
