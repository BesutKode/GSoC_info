I will introduce features which will make developing 2.5D style games easier with PySoy. My efforts will focus on creating custom scenes which will allow creating new "side-scrolling" type of games games without excessive setup. Furthermore, I will develop two thoroughly documented small games to demonstrate the new scenes which shall also serve as examples for other developers on how to use them.
