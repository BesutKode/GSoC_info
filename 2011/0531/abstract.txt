The topic of my work is about preconditioners and more specifically on algebraic multigrid methods. The goal is to develop an efficient parallel implementation for ViennaCL to be used with the already existing solvers and to test those implementations with certain benchmarks and automatic tests. Furthermore, variations of the AMG algorithm will be implemented and tested to both find out a default solution and also to enable users to tweak the algorithm to specific needs.
