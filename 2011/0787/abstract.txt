Eclipse developers use JDT to build awesome Java applications. They use Mylyn to focus their work. They use PDE to domesticate the power of EclipseRT. And they use command line tools to deploy their bundles and features. To improve this, I propose to implement tooling that allows for one-click deployment of any existing Eclipse Feature, for example Eclipse Orion, to Amazonâ€™s EC2.
