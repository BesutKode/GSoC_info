In this project, the specific hardware architecture of the Graphic Processing Unit (GPU) is exploited as a new hardware co-processor to tackle the computational time challenge in the nonlinear algebraic (NLA) solver. 
The proposed novel approach can become an important winning feature for the ASCEND project over other competitor Equation Oriented tools (open source/proprietary).
