WordPress doesn't have an official handbook or a tutorial resources website. Even though the platform is very popular and used by a lot of people, there will always be people that will find hard to read/understand Codex articles and will search for books on topics they couldn't catch up. So the idea I would like to work on, is a new learning resource for WordPress community, that will offer courses, assignments and basic "certification" for everyone who wants to learn WordPress.
