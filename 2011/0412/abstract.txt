Currently, FreedroidRPG provides Lua scripting support for dialog and ingame events. However the scripting support is limited. There are places where some hacks are used to realize the needs of people writing dialogs. In other places there is lack of means to match the needs. The goal of this project is to expand and improve scripting support in FreedroidRPG. The people writing dialogs will receive new tools and theirs work will become more convenient.
