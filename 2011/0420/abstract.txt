Currently I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the department of Computer Science, University of Georgia, USA. 
After reading through the descriptions of proposed projects, XEclipse "RESTification" is of great interest to me. This project involves communication via SOAP and REST-ful Web services and is developed in Eclipse SWT platform, therefore, I might be a potential match for this project based on my skill set.
