Making compositing fast and easy for the user will let independent filmmakers create effects that are too time consuming to create using existing open source software like the GIMP or Blender.  This project will allow users to cut out layers in many frames of video quickly, allowing them to add partially-occluded objects into existing scenes and perform other effects like per-object color correction.  This will be done via optical flow (motion vector) plugins for GStreamer and an UI for PiTiVi.
