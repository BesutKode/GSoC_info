The aim of the umbrella project is to implement a global, real-time network connectivity (websites and services) monitor using a P2P network distributed across the globe. The Mobile P2P agent will be responsible for reporting connectivity issues to the cloud aggregator on the go and on the fly. These Mobile P2P agents will become end-nodes of the P2P network and will act as both servers of data to the cloud aggregator and receivers of notifications for any subscribed events.
