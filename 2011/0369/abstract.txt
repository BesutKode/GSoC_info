For an image handling library the support for a wide array of formats is key. While OpenImageIO already has an impressive spectrum of available plug-ins, it still lacks the support for several popular formats. This project aims to fill the gaps in the list of supported formats, starting out with finishing the already half-baked Cineon, then moving on to Adobe DNG and finally sorting out the unfinished DDS plugin.
