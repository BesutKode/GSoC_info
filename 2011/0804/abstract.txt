Computational Linear Algebra is numerically mastered by numpy/scipy. But there is no open source library which handles Linear Algebra for matrices with symbolic content. My project is to write sparse matrix algorithms for symbolic matrices. 
Matrices will majorly support exact ints, rational numbers, real numbers, polynomials, rational functions and finally algebraic expression as its elements.
