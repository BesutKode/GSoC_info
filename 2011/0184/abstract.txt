The homogenization algorithms used to correct for discontinuities and errors in collections of empirical temperature records are a "black box" to the general public. This project will translate the algorithm used in the modern United States Historical Climatology Network and two legacy ones into clearly-coded, easy-to-understand Python to boost both public understanding of climate science, and to set an example for future scientists wishing to explore the use of Python in their work.
