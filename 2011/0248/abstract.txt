LibreOffice Draw is a multi-purpose vector graphics tool widely considered an open source alternative to the commercial vector diagramming software Microsoft Visio. This project aims to create a Visio import filter for Draw such that major elements of Visio documents can be viewed and manipulated. Further, the Visio parser will be modularised and given an interface which can then be used by other vector-based graphics projects, benefiting the wider community.
