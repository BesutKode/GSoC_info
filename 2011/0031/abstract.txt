Recently emerged services computing technology enables scientists to expose data and computational resources as publicly accessible Web services. Scientists may then utilize published Web services to facilitate in building new scientific workflows, which precisely describe multistep procedures to streamline a composition of tasks and the dataflow among them. However, earlier study shows that services are currently poorly reused in an ad hoc style. Aiming to help domain scientists dynamically fin
