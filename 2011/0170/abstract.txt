The GO is a major bioinformatics initiative to unify the representation of gene and gene product attributes. And Cytoscape is a widely used open source bioinformatics software platform for visualizing molecular interaction networks and integrating multiple types of state data. But there is not any software can integrate those two wonderful resources. I am planning to develop GO Layout plugin for Cytoscape, which can be used to partition and layout biological network driven by GO annotation.
