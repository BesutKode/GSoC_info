The gsoc will consist of three parts. In the first part support for OpenMP-like parallelism will be provided, where the sharing attributes and reduction variables are automatically inferred (CEP 524). In the second part Fused Types (CEP 522) will be implemented, which will "fuse" multiple types into one generic type, to allow a single implementation for distinct types. In the last part CEP 517 (Typed Memory Views) will be implemented, where a Cython array type will provide views on data.
