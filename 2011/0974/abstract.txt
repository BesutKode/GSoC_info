Nowadays Android malware is more and more threatening and so we would like to provide a powerful tool for analyzers to analyze the samples manually. To implement a prototype GUI to aide static analysis, I’d like to use PyQT as the framework of the prototype. Because PyQT provides a complete interface to QT applications and python can interact with androguard easily. We can reuse some androguard’s codes. Other features are presented, such as syntax highlighting and so on.
