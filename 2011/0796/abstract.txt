The Project contains the following steps :
1) Revisit the design of MMtk to faciliate support for concurrent and on the fly algorithms.
2) Implementing an Efficient Mark & Sweep Garbage Collector based on the snapshot Mechanism.
3) Implement a mark & sweep on the fly collector, based on the sliding views mechanism.
