The project aims at developing “demo” models (code along with internal and external documentation) to strengthen the RepastS Library. RepastS is a modeling and simulating software. The models will help in better understanding to the software and various phenomenon modeled. They will act as templates or basic units that can be used to incorporate various possibilities thus developing a complex model. Documentation will help in explaining the parameters and underlying theory.
