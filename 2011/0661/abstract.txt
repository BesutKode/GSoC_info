This project aims to clean up the existing IPv6 implementation in gPXE and continue implementing such features as autoconfiguration (via router advertisement and stateless autoconfiguration), DNS AAAA records, and DHCPv6.

The project will also involve testing with several IPv6 network configurations in order to handle some of the unusual configurations that exist in the "real world".
