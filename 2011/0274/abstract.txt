I hope to implement: Rendering presets - Enable users to select their output format without codec/container knowledge. Also let us package a default set of presets. Should be able to export and import presets. Video Uploader - To directly upload video to services like YouTube, DailyMotion, Vimeo and Archive.org. To code various GUI enhancements demanded by the PiTiVi community to make PiTiVi intuitive to use even for a video editing newbie.
