As an existing project in the ideas list, it aims to use multi-threaded programming to impose parallelism based on multicore/shared memory architecture. As OpenMP is a well known specification for parallel programming, it is performed in a neat way without hassle in messaging passing or load balancing, and supports hybrid programming with MPI as well. The expected results include a usable R-OpenMP package that will reside on CRAN servers with good performance, compatibility and user experience.
