System Security Service Daemon is daemon that provides authentication to remote resource through a common framework that can provide caching and offline support to the system. Through this project SUDO plugin support is added to the SSSD  which uses the LDAp schema support of SUDO 1.8v. Using this plugin SUDO can be configured to use custom rules. So that we can alter authorization rules so as to provide cached access to LDAP. This will make it easier to maintain centralized sudo rules.
