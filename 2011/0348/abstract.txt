Most of the existing VPN solutions are based on user space tunneling and consume a large amount of CPU. Kernel based solutions are more efficient in terms of CPU load but still consume CPU resources on cryptographic operations which sometimes are not even required. The idea of L-VN is to exploit the IP/UDP encapsulation kernel module to develop a VPN/Overlay tool based on IP/UDP encapsulation performed in kernel space with no "security services" for the encapsulated packets.
