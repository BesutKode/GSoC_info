Since Java 5, Java has introduced the java.util.concurrent API. But the Castor project has not supported java.util.concurrent API yet. In the Castor JDO module, the LockEngine implements the read/write lock, and use custom lock mechanism. So the LockEngine is very complicated and error-prone. The “Refactor Lock Engine” project I propose here will refactor the Castor to support the java.util.concurrent API, and make LockEngine more readable and maintainable, and repair some concurrency bugs.
