Rendering real-time self-shadowing dynamic transparent objects, such as clouds, smoke or hair is a problem which cannot be solved using common shadowing techniques such as show mapping or stencil shows. The solution is to create multiple shadow maps which store transparency and interpolate between the values stored in these textures, by using either opacity shadow maps or deep shadow maps.
