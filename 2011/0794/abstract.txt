The project aims at taking the Gluon library ahead and adding essential features to its game distribution support as it prepares for its first release.
Gluon is a cross-platform free and open source game engine from KDE. It aims to make life easier for game developers by providing a simple but powerful API to handle objects, sounds and input.
