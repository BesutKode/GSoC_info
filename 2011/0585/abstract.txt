This project reffers to the idea: http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2011/Ideas#Project:_Advanced_selection_using_SIOX It is about an advanced image foreground selection tool. I am a computer science student, experienced programmer and I believe I can accomplish this project. My intention is to join an open source project for a long period and Google Summer of Code came as a great motivation.
