For Google Summer of Code 2011, I am proposing to add stereoscopic playback to the VideoLAN project and specifically to the VLC media player. Stereoscopy, informally known as 3D, refers to the process where two separate images are displayed to the viewer simultaneously, one image assigned to each eye, giving the illusion depth and volume. Upon completion of my Summer of Code project a user will be able to playback, with the correct equipment, stereoscopic video through the VLC media player.
