This project aims at integrating ontologies as a source for data structures. This includes automatic creation of database tables and form descriptions as well as possibilites to share these data structures between installations.

The main goal is to ease creation of new data types by reusing existing ontologies, and reducing the number of redundant data types that exist among different extensions (de-coupling of data structures and plugins)
