This project aims at integrating as-rigid-as-possible surface modeling algorithm, which is a widely used for geometric deformation, into CGAL. The algorithm takes a triangular surface mesh and vertex handles as input, then output the deformed mesh satisfying positional constraints. The main tasks concentrate on computing the cotangent Laplacian of mesh, taking singular value decomposition to covariance matrices and solving linear sparse system.
