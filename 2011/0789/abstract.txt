Rules 2 is a module for drupal 7, that allows users implement workflows using actions that depend on events and conditions.
The goal of this project is to extend the module by 3 points:
- A Queuing should be introduced,
- a costum links module should be implemented
- and some usability improvements should be made.
Especially sites with complex rule sets, like shopping sites or community portals, would benefit from such a additions.
