The goal of this project is to improve the existing Bengali - English Language pair to a release quality. Specifically, completing both the monolingual and bilingual dictionary and writing the necessary transfer rules. Finally, testvocing is also necessary to ensure correctness. 

This project would be the continuation of the apertium 2009 project on "conversion of Anubadok to apertium platform"
