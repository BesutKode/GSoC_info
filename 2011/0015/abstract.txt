Btrfs is a new copy on write file system for Linux aimed at implementing advanced features while focusing on fault tolerance, repair and easy administration.

Currently the xfs test suite is used to validate the base functionality of btrfs. It would be good to extend it to test btrfs-specific functions like snapshot creation/deletion, balancing and relocation.
