I am interested in “A Graph Layout for Reaction Networks”. My main motivation is that this project requires effective algorithms and data structures. Being well-versed in algorithm designing and interested in biology and organic chemistry, I am able to do good contribution to this OSS project. In my application, I will elaborate my motivation, my academic and working experience as well as personal information, my project proposal, and my time line.
