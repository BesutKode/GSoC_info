I am submitting my proposal on GPU implementation in CCV. In the latest release of CCV, GPU support was removed, hence I found it as a good opportunity to contribute to the community this summer. I will be using Nvidia CUDA to achieve this goal. The deliverables I will be providing as initial implementation this summer will be GPU filtering and GPU blob finding. I will be leaving the task of blob tracking to CPU because porting of knn algorithm on GPU might adversely affect CCV performance.
