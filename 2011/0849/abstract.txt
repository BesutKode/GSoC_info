The idea beyond this project is to analyze the usefulness of different clock models for NTP, contributing for an enhanced performance. The goal is to use filtering techniques to analyze 2 issues. The first is a parameter that provides an explicit connection between the polling interval and the accuracy of the synchronization process. The second issue is a more sophisticated model for the performance of the clock on the local system and for the network delay.
