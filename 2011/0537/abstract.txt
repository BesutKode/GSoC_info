This project aims to complete issues #44 and #55 as found here https://github.com/fosslc/freeseer/issues/44 and https://github.com/fosslc/freeseer/issues/55 respectively. Which will allow Freeseer to automatically upload all videos in a directory to video hosting site that allows scp/sftp upload, alternatively this project will allow uploading to a Drupal based website. Currently Freeseer has no such capability therefore uploading “talks” or videos has to be done manually which is time consuming
