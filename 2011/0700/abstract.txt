The wxiOS project is an effort to create a wxWidgets based C++ wrapper over Cocoa Touch that would implement the proposed wxMobile API. The implementation would allow creating mobile UIs in a more generic, platform-independent way. If, for example, an analogue gets implemented for Android OS, one could expect to run the same end-user mobile application code on both mobile platforms without too much hassle.
