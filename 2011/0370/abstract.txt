The University Studies program needs to match mentors to particular courses. The mentor takes a survey and is asked questions to determine which courses will be a good fit. The questions ask pertain to time-slot, department, theme, and faculty. Course descriptions, the mentor survey, and other configuration information will be loaded into the tool and an optimal, valid schedule will be produced based on the input.
