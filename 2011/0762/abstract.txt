This stand alone GUI will format large multi-locus datasets with no reference genome. It will allow researchers with genome-enriched next-generation sequencing data to easily view and modify any subset of their data with a single click (which is currently achieved with tedious formatting by hand and not aided by currently available genomic tools). This program will output four commonly used population genetics analysis formats (NEXUS, FASTA, IMa2, migrate) and focus on user-friendliness.
