The task of computing nearest neigbours in n-D point cloud data is at the core of many algorithms in PCL,
optimising this would result in a speed-up across many parts of PCL. 
Parallellisation is the key to this speed-up, be it on CPU or GPU. The parallellisation a GPU offers is perfect for optimising this core bottleneck.
The kd-tree data structure is not a straight fit for GPU parallellisation,
so there is the need for an adapted kd-tree data structure that is suitable for a GPU implementation
