The Repast Simphony (RepastS) 2.0 Beta version currently needs well-documented demo-models to help introduce users to building complex adaptive systems with RepastS.  These demos will also be served as a testing suite on new features.  Using examples from the NetLogo models library or its user community models, ten or more models can be created over the GSoC session.  The deliverables include the coded models and documentation.
