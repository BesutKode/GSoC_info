The goals of this project are:
* Standardize the XML encoding of gene tree reconciliation data by extending an existing standard
* Implement this encoding in a standard bioinformatics library (BioPerl)
* Modify the iPlant GTR database to support import and export of GTR trees using the new encoding
* If time permits, modify the iPlant tree visualization tool so that it internally uses the new encoding
* If time permits, use iPlant's taxa resolution to populate taxonomic name strings
