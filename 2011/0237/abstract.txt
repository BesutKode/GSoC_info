User Objects will replace the current "who" string for managing users in Buildbot. This will be achieved with a collection of functions that interface with various storage protocols to retrieve or store user information. If user credentials are retrieved, the returns will be operated on by another collection of functions, allowing for verification and editing of user information. The project will test with git, add web authentication, and work towards laying a framework for user management.
