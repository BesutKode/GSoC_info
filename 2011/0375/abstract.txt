The task of computing nearest neighbors in n-D point cloud data is at the core of many algorithms in PCL, optimizing this would result in a speedup across many parts of PCL. Currently, the nearest-neighbor searches in PCL are performed on CPU, using a kd-tree data structure which is known to be efficient for searching low dimensionality spaces.
