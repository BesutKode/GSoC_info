My goal for this project is to give OpenCV users a single resource of information that fills all their programming needs and answers all their questions.  Either if you are a first-time user or a intermediate-level one, we should provide you with interesting, easy-to-understand and enticing material that makes you feel curious and motivated about Computer Vision (and also, we should convince you that OpenCV  is the way to go)
