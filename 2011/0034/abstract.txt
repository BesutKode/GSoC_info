I propose to extend the JPF-Inspector tool with several new features, including:

backward single stepping, 
­batch execution from command-line, 
program state modification,
­introspection of the JPF internal state,
simple integration with IDE, UI improvements,
profiling info.

The goal is to improve the JPF-Inspector and make it a mature and useful tool.
