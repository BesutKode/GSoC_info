I would like to create a CI infrastructure and set it up to provide complete build services for one particular neuroinformatics project (NEST).

Implementation would be such that further projects can be added by writing appropriate glue code, maintenance of the build slaves is automated, self-documenting and reproducible. A research question would be whether a compile farm can be provided using the same configuration of slaves (1) and if NEST can be built in parallel (2).
