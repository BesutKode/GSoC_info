In this project we are aiming to extend the functionality of OSRM by writing a plugin which takes the route output given by OSRM engine and provides "turn directions" as an output to the user so that he can navigate easily along the route. We also work on improving the efficiency of current engine by adding compression techniques for efficient memory management.  This makes index lookups faster and thus results in faster throughputs.
