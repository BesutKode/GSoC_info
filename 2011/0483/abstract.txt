Currently in sympy, there is support for discrete Hilbert spaces, which are quite useful for spin calculations or symbolic quantum computing. However, there is only very preliminary support for continuous Hilbert spaces. The goal of this project would be to implement position/momentum representations for operators and eigenstates in various coordinate systems, including cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical, as well as implementing many "textbook" example QM systems.
