OpenMRS is a huge system, which is written to be scalable and configurable. This model requires creating a large quantity of metadata. It would be great if the application administrator could share metadata, in order to others didn't have to repeat his work. This project will enable sharing metadata through the Internet, allowing subscribing a “package” from given URL. All I want to do is to give users an useful module, which will help them in everyday work.
