Denemo supports a variety of MIDI and audio backends, all of which offer different feature sets. The goal of this proposal is to clean up, restructure and partly rewrite the MIDI and audio code, so that all currently implemented features can be used irrespective of the underlying audio API. Once input/output, soundfont rendering and GUI code are clearly separated from each other, ensuring the realtime-safety of Denemo's JACK support will be relatively easy.
