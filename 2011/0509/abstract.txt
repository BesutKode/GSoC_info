A machine learning toolkit will implement multiple variants of the genetic algorithm (GA), including extensions to coevolving and spatially-distributed populations. Implementation will support user-defined fitness functions, performance measurement tools to study evolutionary dynamics, and highly configurable evolutionary search parameters for best quality results. The toolkit will be applicable in educational, scientific, and engineering settings.
