Apache Woden is an open source framework that implements the W3C WSDL 2.0 specification which is used for WSDL 2.0 manipulation in popular frameworks such as Apache Axis2.

OASIS XML catalog defines a standard catalog format for XML URI and Entities and it also defines a resolver mechanism.  . The main objective of this proposal is to replace Wodenâ€™s simple URI resolving mechanism by OASIS XML catalog and resolving existing issues reported by users of Woden and Axis2.
