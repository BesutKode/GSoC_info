My project consists of segregating the backend & UI logic for Login/Account Creation, tracking the "source avenue" for account creation & suggesting "exit activities" & enhancing the usability of forms. 
The main purpose of this project is to ensure that the process of account 
creation (or login) does not wildly interrupt the user's task flow. This will help Wikipedia (& other Wikis) in offering a better user experience & thus increase the number of 'converted' users.
