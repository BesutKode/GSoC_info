It would be nice to able to use libvlc from other languages. There're autogenerated bindings for python, and it has nice class interface, but it requires to managing reference count (to call release() in the end) manually, which is not very pythony.
The plan is to make an autogenerated C++ wrapper around C libvlc. Reference counting will be automatic via constructors/destructors. Produced wrapper will be used as input for SWIG, which can make bindings for many different languages.
