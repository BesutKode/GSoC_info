GIMME, originally developed for Google's Summer of Code in 2010, is a well-rounded XMMS2 interface for GNU Emacs that provides a minimalistic and intuitive user experience through searches, powered by collection operations. It works very nicely, but still lacks the polishing top-quality Emacs packages have, modern features other interfaces have and a userbase. I propose to work on all of these issues in this summer.
