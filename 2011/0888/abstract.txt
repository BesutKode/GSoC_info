A collection of approximately eight agent-based models will be developed and implemented in Repast Simphony (RepastS).  The models will demonstrate the capabilities of RepastS, illustrate the use of different toolkits, and identify features that could be improved or added to RepastS.  Comprehensive documentation will also be provided to facilitate understanding and learning by other users.
