I am Mayte Gim√©nez, and I am a last year student of computer science at the Polytechnic University of Valencia, Spain. Right now I am working at University at Sakai development team with David Roldan. I have been working with Sakai for the last 3 years, always with scholarships. A cross platform application has a lot of advantages for education institutions and I would like to make myself useful in this new opportunity, developing  a native application.
