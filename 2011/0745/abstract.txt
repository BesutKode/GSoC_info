Imagine the world where computers are handling all critical situations. In order to maximize application reliability, production versions should not differ from the testing version. Achieving that is possible using annotations which are detected at runtime. The aim of Checking Java Annotation project is to develop a set of annotations that can be applied to Java programs to assist tools that detect software defects.
