TYPO3 is right in a big rebuilding phase and will make a huge
technical step from version 4 to version 5. Basis of the
new version will be the FLOW3 Framework which is just maturing into its beta phase. One of the new concepts is the 
implementation of a Content Repository (CR) which transparently
persists data in form of Nodes in a hierarchical Node-Tree.
For making the transition as smooth as possible, there is a need of
functionalities to transform TYPO3v4 contents into CR-compatible data.
