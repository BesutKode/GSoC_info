Apache Lucene supports indexing and searching for numeric types. This allows Lucene to support faster range queries, since building the field cache is much faster than using text-only numbers. One of the big limits today is the lack of support for numeric range queries in Lucene contrib query parser, which still only supports text range queries. This project proposes to implement numeric support in contrib query parser.
