Here I propose to create a Reactome R package for the purposes of pathway enrichment analysis.  The process of pathway analysis can be greatly enhanced with the integration of existing Bioconductor packages and the implementation of the R statistical programming language.  The deliverables expected by this project would include a Reactome R library with a pathway enrichment analysis package, R-based pathway diagrams visualization function, Vignettes, and User guide documents.
