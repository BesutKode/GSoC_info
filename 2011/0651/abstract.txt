I propose to further develop ImpactProbe, a web application to be used by primary investigators and others (user) to analyze the social impact of their outreach activities by monitoring Internet social media. Features will be added to optimize collection of relevant data and the application will be extended to gather data from additional sources. A freely accessible public web server will be created allowing users to create password-protected accounts to collect, analyze, and export their data.
