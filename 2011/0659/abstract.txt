Analysis of disease data is important in order to detect disease outbreaks and risk factors. Some of the methods for cluster detection have been implemented in the DCluster package. However, a model-based approach would be of interest in order to explore disease incidence to potential risk factors. Model-based clustering will be implemented using Generalized Linear Models. Hence, many possible clusters will be proposed and the most likely cluster will be selected using model selection techniques
