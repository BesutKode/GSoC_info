wxWidgets currently lacks any classes for modern web viewing. The built in wxHTML classes are only suitable for viewing simple HTML files with basic CSS support. This proposal aims to integrate the wxWebView patch by Marianne Gagnon into wxWidgets by adding build support, creating documentation and unit tests and finishing functionality. If time allows it also aims to add extra back-ends and improve the current HTML help system using the new class.
