In this proposal, the multi-cam support module for CCV will be introduced.  By integrating the  methods related to Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction of OpenCV into CCV, we can make the CCV track the blobs with the relationship between the multi-cams and the screen,  and then we can track the objects and fiducials by stitching the undistorted and rectified captured by multi-cams.
