Crypto Stick is a safe storage for private key. It allows to store private key as easy as on USB dongle, but it prevents private key leak.
One of standards for PKI storages is PKCS (Public-Key Cryptography System), which is made by RSA.
My goal is to adapt OpenSC libraries (whose implements PKCS#11) to work with Crypto Stick.
