KMail is a email client for KDE and the goal has always been to make KMail a program that is beautiful and intuitive without sacrificing power. Currently KMail is having all the basic set of features and a solid framework. But it is lacking a very important and one of the most sought after features (mostly by businessmen), which is the ability to reply to and forward HTML mail with the same format as it was received. So the goal of this project will be to implement this HTML support.
