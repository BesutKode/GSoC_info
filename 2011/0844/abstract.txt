Data collected by the OpenMRS system is stored as patient specific observations. However the current API only supports a finite list of data types for observables. It does not allow users to introduce Observations for OpenMRS domain objects such as Patients or Locations Etc. This project will resolve this issue by enhancing the existing API to allow users to create observations for such domain objects.
