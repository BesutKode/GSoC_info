OpenNMS is a powerful Network monitoring and management system. Hibernate transition project was started long time ago. There is a need to finish converting OpenNMS to use Hibernate (with Spring) to read/update data from internal database. By finishing this transition, OpenNMS would be able to work with any underlaying database management system. This project mainly focus on identifying the areas where this transition is needed and change them using DAO design pattern.
