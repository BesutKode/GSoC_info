My name is Christopher Zakian and I am a Computer Science and Linguistics major at IU Bloomington. I became interested in the Universal Search box after talking with Jeremy when OpenMRS did an Info Session at IU. This project would combine my study of Language in linguistics with computer science to benefit OpenMRS.
