The idea behind this project is to share the participants between the surveys. As of now, the participants we add are survey specific, however, once this system is ready it will be possible to add participants to the Limesurvey installation/server as a whole and then add participants to the survey. Each participant will be allocated a unique participant_id which will be constant across the surveys.
