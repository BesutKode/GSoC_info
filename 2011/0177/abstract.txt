I propose a concise suite of mesh retopology tools for Blender BMesh, building upon the existing tools. While Blender already offers an extensive suite of tools for creating and modifying meshes that will soon be improved by the release of BMesh, the proposed retopology tools are to focus on work flow and use. The intention is to make these functions more accessible to the user, and empower the artist with new and faster methods of common retopology tasks.
