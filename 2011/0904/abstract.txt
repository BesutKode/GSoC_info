This is a plan to work in several parts of the GNOME websites and make them an organized and interesting way to get all kind of information around the project. This plan consists of some small tasks to create new features for GNOME.org, to make all the subdomains equally design-wise, to reorganize library.gnome.org and to create a new subdomain in GNOME website that will keep track of what happens in the community.
