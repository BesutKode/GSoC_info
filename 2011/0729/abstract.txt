Tekla is a collection of mobile open source and open hardware applications that may be used to enable access to, and extend the functionality of, mobile devices for people with motor impairments.. Goal of project is to develop a framework that enables 3rd party applications to leverage from existing Tekla structure to make their applications completely accessible to people with mobility impairments. Currently Tekla does not provide direct access to third party applications.
