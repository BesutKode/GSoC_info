Idea:
The goal is to implement a live on-canvas iWarp like tool.

Behavior:
The basic usecase of this tool would be:
1. The user select the iwarp tool. Nothing is displayed on top of the image.
2. If needed, the user select a particular behavior for the tool (drag,shrink, grow, whirl, pinch ..)
3. The user do a stroke on the canvas. The image is updated accordingly.
