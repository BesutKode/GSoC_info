TreeBASE acts as a archive for phylogenetic analyses. The current submission of data to TreeBASE is via NEXUS files. However, this format results in a clunky user interface and does not allow for automated submission of metadata or additional annotations to be added. This project will take on the task of accepting NeXML files to TreeBASE so that the submission process of metadata to be easily submitted and so that new annotations of the metadata can be displayed in a user-friendly manner.
