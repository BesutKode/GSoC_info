Capturing landscapes isn't always possible with one photo. With the generalization of cameras, more and more people would expect to be able to capture those landscape with their camera with several photos and stitch them later by software. This is what Hugin is doing. However its powerfulness comes at a price: complexity. The goal of this project is to use the tools Hugin is using and develop a Kipi plugin capable of automatizing the stitching process with good results.
