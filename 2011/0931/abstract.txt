This project is to lay the foundations of BGL v2. The new library focuses on ease of use, replacement of property maps for labels, data structures with more concise and clear semantics, a new graph concept hierarchy, implementing graph algorithms to align with STL abstractions, and, finally, integrate C++0x into the BGL. Some of these new design goals are inspired by topics which occur with some frequency in the Boost users mailing list.
