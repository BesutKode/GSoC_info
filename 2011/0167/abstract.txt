I would like to write a full-fledged JavaScript testing framework for Drupal. As Drupal has grown, it has incorporated more and more JavaScript into its user interface, so being able to test JavaScript is critical in ensuring that the user interface is functional. A JavaScript testing framework could be used for unit tests, such as for API functions like Drupal.checkPlain(), as well as for logical functional tests of complex user interface pieces, such as tabledrag.
