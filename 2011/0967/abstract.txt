It's main purpose is to develop a new password hashing method for servers. The general idea is to use concepts of scrypt algorithm, iterations, parallelism, memory usage and local parameterization, in order to compute hashes in reasonable time on servers and, at the same time, make the passwords harder to be cracked by attackers. It will be better explored through a FPGA implementation, but GPUs could be studied as well.
