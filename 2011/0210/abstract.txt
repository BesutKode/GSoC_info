The idea of Internet Connectivity Monitor Aggregator is to construct a website that displays the information gathered by different agents placed all over the world. In this website is possible to see all the events reported by the agents, like a failure accessing some website or service, and a world map showing the connectivity between routers. These events will be reported automatically in RSS feed, published into facebook and twitter, and emailed to users that subscribed that alerts.
